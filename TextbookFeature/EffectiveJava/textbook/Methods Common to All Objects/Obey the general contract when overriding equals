  Overriding the equals method seems simple, but there are many ways to get it wrong, and consequences can be dire. The easiest way to avoid problems is not to override the equals method, in which case each instance of the class is equal only to itself. This is the right thing to do if any of the following conditions apply: • Each instance of the class is inherently unique. This is true for classes such as Thread that represent active entities rather than values. The equals implementation provided by Object has exactly the right behavior for these classes. 
  • There is no need for the class to provide a “logical equality” test. For example, java.util.regex.Pattern could have overridden equals to check whether two Pattern instances represented exactly the same regular expression, but the designers didn’t think that clients would need or want this functionality. Under these circumstances, the equals implementation inherited from Object is ideal. 
  • A superclass has already overridden equals, and the superclass behavior is appropriate for this class. For example, most Set implementations inherit their equals implementation from AbstractSet, List implementations from AbstractList, and Map implementations from AbstractMap. 
  • The class is private or package-private, and you are certain that its equals method will never be invoked. If you are extremely risk-averse, you can override the equals method to ensure that it isn’t invoked accidentally: @Override public boolean equals(Object o) { throw new AssertionError(); // Method is never called } 
  So when is it appropriate to override equals? It is when a class has a notion of logical equality that differs from mere object identity and a superclass has not already overridden equals. This is generally the case for value classes. A value class is simply a class that represents a value, such as Integer or String. A programmer who compares references to value objects using the equals method expects to find out whether they are logically equivalent, not whether they refer to the same object. Not only is overriding the equals method necessary to satisfy programmer expectations, it enables instances to serve as map keys or set elements with predictable, desirable behavior. 
  One kind of value class that does not require the equals method to be overridden is a class that uses instance control (Item 1) to ensure that at most one object exists with each value. Enum types (Item 34) fall into this category. For these classes, logical equality is the same as object identity, so Object’s equals method functions as a logical equals method. 
  When you override the equals method, you must adhere to its general contract. Here is the contract, from the specification for Object : The equals method implements an equivalence relation. It has these properties: • Reflexive: For any non-null reference value x, x.equals(x) must return true. 
  • Symmetric: For any non-null reference values x and y, x.equals(y) must return true if and only if y.equals(x) returns true. 
  • Transitive: For any non-null reference values x, y, z, if x.equals(y) returns true and y.equals(z) returns true, then x.equals(z) must return true. 
  • Consistent: For any non-null reference values x and y, multiple invocations of x.equals(y) must consistently return true or consistently return false, provided no information used in equals comparisons is modified. 
  • For any non-null reference value x, x.equals(null) must return false. 
  Unless you are mathematically inclined, this might look a bit scary, but do not ignore it! If you violate it, you may well find that your program behaves erratically or crashes, and it can be very difficult to pin down the source of the failure. To paraphrase John Donne, no class is an island. Instances of one class are frequently passed to another. Many classes, including all collections classes, depend on the objects passed to them obeying the equals contract. 
  Now that you are aware of the dangers of violating the equals contract, let’s go over the contract in detail. The good news is that, appearances notwithstanding, it really isn’t very complicated. Once you understand it, it’s not hard to adhere to it. 
  So what is an equivalence relation? Loosely speaking, it’s an operator that partitions a set of elements into subsets whose elements are deemed equal to one another. These subsets are known as equivalence classes. For an equals method to be useful, all of the elements in each equivalence class must be interchangeable from the perspective of the user. Now let’s examine the five requirements in turn: Reflexivity—The first requirement says merely that an object must be equal to itself. It’s hard to imagine violating this one unintentionally. If you were to violate it and then add an instance of your class to a collection, the contains method might well say that the collection didn’t contain the instance that you just added. 
  Symmetry—The second requirement says that any two objects must agree on whether they are equal. Unlike the first requirement, it’s not hard to imagine violating this one unintentionally. For example, consider the following class, which implements a case-insensitive string. The case of the string is preserved by toString but ignored in equals comparisons: // Broken - violates symmetry! 
  public final class CaseInsensitiveString { private final String s; 
  public CaseInsensitiveString(String s) { this.s = Objects.requireNonNull(s); 
  } 
  // Broken - violates symmetry! 
  @Override public boolean equals(Object o) { if (o instanceof CaseInsensitiveString) return s.equalsIgnoreCase( ((CaseInsensitiveString) o).s); 
  if (o instanceof String) // One-way interoperability! 
  return s.equalsIgnoreCase((String) o); 
  return false; 
  } 
  ... // Remainder omitted } 
  The well-intentioned equals method in this class naively attempts to interoperate with ordinary strings. Let’s suppose that we have one case-insensitive string and one ordinary one: CaseInsensitiveString cis = new CaseInsensitiveString("Polish"); 
  String s = "polish"; 
  As expected, cis.equals(s) returns true. The problem is that while the equals method in CaseInsensitiveString knows about ordinary strings, the equals method in String is oblivious to case-insensitive strings. Therefore, s.equals(cis) returns false, a clear violation of symmetry. Suppose you put a case-insensitive string into a collection: List<CaseInsensitiveString> list = new ArrayList<>(); 
  list.add(cis); 
  What does list.contains(s) return at this point? Who knows? In the current OpenJDK implementation, it happens to return false, but that’s just an implementation artifact. In another implementation, it could just as easily return true or throw a runtime exception. Once you’ve violated the equals contract, you simply don’t know how other objects will behave when confronted with your object. 
  To eliminate the problem, merely remove the ill-conceived attempt to interoperate with String from the equals method. Once you do this, you can refactor the method into a single return statement: @Override public boolean equals(Object o) { return o instanceof CaseInsensitiveString && ((CaseInsensitiveString) o).s.equalsIgnoreCase(s); 
  } 
  Transitivity—The third requirement of the equals contract says that if one object is equal to a second and the second object is equal to a third, then the first object must be equal to the third. Again, it’s not hard to imagine violating this requirement unintentionally. Consider the case of a subclass that adds a new value component to its superclass. In other words, the subclass adds a piece of information that affects equals comparisons. Let’s start with a simple immutable two-dimensional integer point class: public class Point { private final int x; 
  private final int y; 
  public Point(int x, int y) { this.x = x; 
  this.y = y; 
  } 
  @Override public boolean equals(Object o) { if (!(o instanceof Point)) return false; 
  Point p = (Point)o; 
  return p.x == x && p.y == y; 
  } 
  ... 
  // Remainder omitted } 
  Suppose you want to extend this class, adding the notion of color to a point: public class ColorPoint extends Point { private final Color color; 
  public ColorPoint(int x, int y, Color color) { super(x, y); 
  this.color = color; 
  } 
  ... 
  // Remainder omitted } 
  How should the equals method look? If you leave it out entirely, the implementation is inherited from Point and color information is ignored in equals comparisons. While this does not violate the equals contract, it is clearly unacceptable. Suppose you write an equals method that returns true only if its argument is another color point with the same position and color: // Broken - violates symmetry! 
  @Override public boolean equals(Object o) { if (!(o instanceof ColorPoint)) return false; 
  return super.equals(o) && ((ColorPoint) o).color == color; 
  } 
  The problem with this method is that you might get different results when comparing a point to a color point and vice versa. The former comparison ignores color, while the latter comparison always returns false because the type of the argument is incorrect. To make this concrete, let’s create one point and one color point: Point p = new Point(1, 2); 
  ColorPoint cp = new ColorPoint(1, 2, Color.RED); 
  Then p.equals(cp) returns true, while cp.equals(p) returns false. You might try to fix the problem by having ColorPoint.equals ignore color when doing “mixed comparisons”: // Broken - violates transitivity! 
  @Override public boolean equals(Object o) { if (!(o instanceof Point)) return false; 
  // If o is a normal Point, do a color-blind comparison if (!(o instanceof ColorPoint)) return o.equals(this); 
  // o is a ColorPoint; do a full comparison return super.equals(o) && ((ColorPoint) o).color == color; 
  } 
  This approach does provide symmetry, but at the expense of transitivity: ColorPoint p1 = new ColorPoint(1, 2, Color.RED); 
  Point p2 = new Point(1, 2); 
  ColorPoint p3 = new ColorPoint(1, 2, Color.BLUE); 
  Now p1.equals(p2) and p2.equals(p3) return true, while p1.equals(p3) returns false, a clear violation of transitivity. The first two comparisons are “color-blind,” while the third takes color into account. 
  Also, this approach can cause infinite recursion: Suppose there are two subclasses of Point, say ColorPoint and SmellPoint, each with this sort of equals method. Then a call to myColorPoint.equals(mySmellPoint) will throw a StackOverflowError. 
  So what’s the solution? It turns out that this is a fundamental problem of equivalence relations in object-oriented languages. There is no way to extend an instantiable class and add a value component while preserving the equals contract, unless you’re willing to forgo the benefits of object-oriented abstraction. 
  You may hear it said that you can extend an instantiable class and add a value component while preserving the equals contract by using a getClass test in place of the instanceof test in the equals method: // Broken - violates Liskov substitution principle (page 43) @Override public boolean equals(Object o) { if (o == null || o.getClass() != getClass()) return false; 
  Point p = (Point) o; 
  return p.x == x && p.y == y; 
  } 
  This has the effect of equating objects only if they have the same implementation class. This may not seem so bad, but the consequences are unacceptable: An instance of a subclass of Point is still a Point, and it still needs to function as one, but it fails to do so if you take this approach! Let’s suppose we want to write a method to tell whether a point is on the unit circle. Here is one way we could do it: // Initialize unitCircle to contain all Points on the unit circle private static final Set<Point> unitCircle = Set.of( new Point( 1, 0), new Point( 0, 1), new Point(-1, 0), new Point( 0, -1)); 
  public static boolean onUnitCircle(Point p) { return unitCircle.contains(p); 
  } 
  While this may not be the fastest way to implement the functionality, it works fine. 
  Suppose you extend Point in some trivial way that doesn’t add a value component, say, by having its constructor keep track of how many instances have been created: public class CounterPoint extends Point { private static final AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(); 
  public CounterPoint(int x, int y) { super(x, y); 
  counter.incrementAndGet(); 
  } 
  public static int numberCreated() { return counter.get(); } 
  } 
  The Liskov substitution principle says that any important property of a type should also hold for all its subtypes so that any method written for the type should work equally well on its subtypes [Liskov87]. This is the formal statement of our earlier claim that a subclass of Point (such as CounterPoint) is still a Point and must act as one. But suppose we pass a CounterPoint to the onUnitCircle method. If the Point class uses a getClass-based equals method, the onUnitCircle method will return false regardless of the CounterPoint instance’s x and y coordinates. This is so because most collections, including the HashSet used by the onUnitCircle method, use the equals method to test for containment, and no CounterPoint instance is equal to any Point. If, however, you use a proper instanceof-based equals method on Point, the same onUnitCircle method works fine when presented with a CounterPoint instance. 
  While there is no satisfactory way to extend an instantiable class and add a value component, there is a fine workaround: Follow the advice of Item 18, “Favor composition over inheritance.” Instead of having ColorPoint extend Point, give ColorPoint a private Point field and a public view method (Item 6) that returns the point at the same position as this color point: // Adds a value component without violating the equals contract public class ColorPoint { private final Point point; 
  private final Color color; 
  public ColorPoint(int x, int y, Color color) { point = new Point(x, y); 
  this.color = Objects.requireNonNull(color); 
  } 
  /** * Returns the point-view of this color point. 
  */ public Point asPoint() { return point; 
  } 
  @Override public boolean equals(Object o) { if (!(o instanceof ColorPoint)) return false; 
  ColorPoint cp = (ColorPoint) o; 
  return cp.point.equals(point) && cp.color.equals(color); 
  } 
  ... 
  // Remainder omitted } 
  There are some classes in the Java platform libraries that do extend an instantiable class and add a value component. For example, java.sql.Timestamp extends java.util.Date and adds a nanoseconds field. The equals implementation for Timestamp does violate symmetry and can cause erratic behavior if Timestamp and Date objects are used in the same collection or are otherwise intermixed. The Timestamp class has a disclaimer cautioning programmers against mixing dates and timestamps. While you won’t get into trouble as long as you keep them separate, there’s nothing to prevent you from mixing them, and the resulting errors can be hard to debug. This behavior of the Timestamp class was a mistake and should not be emulated. 
  Note that you can add a value component to a subclass of an abstract class without violating the equals contract. This is important for the sort of class hierarchies that you get by following the advice in Item 23, “Prefer class hierarchies to tagged classes.” For example, you could have an abstract class Shape with no value components, a subclass Circle that adds a radius field, and a subclass Rectangle that adds length and width fields. Problems of the sort shown earlier won’t occur so long as it is impossible to create a superclass instance directly. 
  Consistency—The fourth requirement of the equals contract says that if two objects are equal, they must remain equal for all time unless one (or both) of them is modified. In other words, mutable objects can be equal to different objects at different times while immutable objects can’t. When you write a class, think hard about whether it should be immutable (Item 17). If you conclude that it should, make sure that your equals method enforces the restriction that equal objects remain equal and unequal objects remain unequal for all time. 
  Whether or not a class is immutable, do not write an equals method that depends on unreliable resources. It’s extremely difficult to satisfy the consistency requirement if you violate this prohibition. For example, java.net.URL’s equals method relies on comparison of the IP addresses of the hosts associated with the URLs. Translating a host name to an IP address can require network access, and it isn’t guaranteed to yield the same results over time. This can cause the URL equals method to violate the equals contract and has caused problems in practice. The behavior of URL’s equals method was a big mistake and should not be emulated. Unfortunately, it cannot be changed due to compatibility requirements. To avoid this sort of problem, equals methods should perform only deterministic computations on memory-resident objects. 
  Non-nullity—The final requirement lacks an official name, so I have taken the liberty of calling it “non-nullity.” It says that all objects must be unequal to null. While it is hard to imagine accidentally returning true in response to the invocation o.equals(null), it isn’t hard to imagine accidentally throwing a NullPointerException. 
  equals The general contract prohibits this. Many classes have methods that guard against it with an explicit test for null: @Override public boolean equals(Object o) { if (o == null) return false; 
  ... 
  } 
  This test is unnecessary. To test its argument for equality, the equals method must first cast its argument to an appropriate type so its accessors can be invoked or its fields accessed. Before doing the cast, the method must use the instanceof operator to check that its argument is of the correct type: @Override public boolean equals(Object o) { if (!(o instanceof MyType)) return false; 
  MyType mt = (MyType) o; 
  ... 
  } 
  If this type check were missing and the equals method were passed an argument of the wrong type, the equals method would throw a ClassCastException, which violates the equals contract. But the instanceof operator is specified to return false if its first operand is null, regardless of what type appears in the second operand [JLS, 15.20.2]. Therefore, the type check will return false if null is passed in, so you don’t need an explicit null check. 
  Putting it all together, here’s a recipe for a high-quality equals method: 1. Use the == operator to check if the argument is a reference to this object. 
  If so, return true. This is just a performance optimization but one that is worth doing if the comparison is potentially expensive. 
  2. Use the instanceof operator to check if the argument has the correct type. 
  If not, return false. Typically, the correct type is the class in which the method occurs. Occasionally, it is some interface implemented by this class. Use an interface if the class implements an interface that refines the equals contract to permit comparisons across classes that implement the interface. Collection interfaces such as Set, List, Map, and Map.Entry have this property. 
  3. Cast the argument to the correct type. Because this cast was preceded by an instanceof test, it is guaranteed to succeed. 
  4. For each “significant” field in the class, check if that field of the argument matches the corresponding field of this object. If all these tests succeed, return true; otherwise, return false. If the type in Step 2 is an interface, you must access the argument’s fields via interface methods; if the type is a class, you may be able to access the fields directly, depending on their accessibility. 
  For primitive fields whose type is not float or double, use the == operator for comparisons; for object reference fields, call the equals method recursively; 
  for float fields, use the static Float.compare(float, float) method; and for double fields, use Double.compare(double, double). The special treatment of float and double fields is made necessary by the existence of Float.NaN, -0.0f and the analogous double values; see JLS 15.21.1 or the documentation of Float.equals for details. While you could compare float and double fields with the static methods Float.equals and Double.equals, this would entail autoboxing on every comparison, which would have poor performance. For array fields, apply these guidelines to each element. If every element in an array field is significant, use one of the Arrays.equals methods. 
  Some object reference fields may legitimately contain null. To avoid the possibility of a NullPointerException, check such fields for equality using the static method Objects.equals(Object, Object). 
  For some classes, such as CaseInsensitiveString above, field comparisons are more complex than simple equality tests. If this is the case, you may want to store a canonical form of the field so the equals method can do a cheap exact comparison on canonical forms rather than a more costly nonstandard comparison. This technique is most appropriate for immutable classes (Item 17); if the object can change, you must keep the canonical form up to date. 
  The performance of the equals method may be affected by the order in which fields are compared. For best performance, you should first compare fields that are more likely to differ, less expensive to compare, or, ideally, both. You must not compare fields that are not part of an object’s logical state, such as lock fields used to synchronize operations. You need not compare derived fields, which can be calculated from “significant fields,” but doing so may improve the performance of the equals method. If a derived field amounts to a summary description of the entire object, comparing this field will save you the expense of comparing the actual data if the comparison fails. For example, suppose you have a Polygon class, and you cache the area. If two polygons have unequal areas, you needn’t bother comparing their edges and vertices. 
  When you are finished writing your equals method, ask yourself three questions: Is it symmetric? Is it transitive? Is it consistent? And don’t just ask yourself; write unit tests to check, unless you used AutoValue (page 49) to generate your equals method, in which case you can safely omit the tests. If the properties fail to hold, figure out why, and modify the equals method accordingly. Of course your equals method must also satisfy the other two properties (reflexivity and non-nullity), but these two usually take care of themselves. 
  An equals method constructed according to the previous recipe is shown in this simplistic PhoneNumber class: // Class with a typical equals method public final class PhoneNumber { private final short areaCode, prefix, lineNum; 
  public PhoneNumber(int areaCode, int prefix, int lineNum) { this.areaCode = rangeCheck(areaCode, 999, "area code"); 
  this.prefix = rangeCheck(prefix, 999, "prefix"); 
  this.lineNum = rangeCheck(lineNum, 9999, "line num"); 
  } 
  private static short rangeCheck(int val, int max, String arg) { if (val < 0 || val > max) throw new IllegalArgumentException(arg + ": " + val); 
  return (short) val; 
  } 
  @Override public boolean equals(Object o) { if (o == this) return true; 
  if (!(o instanceof PhoneNumber)) return false; 
  PhoneNumber pn = (PhoneNumber)o; 
  return pn.lineNum == lineNum && pn.prefix == prefix && pn.areaCode == areaCode; 
  } 
  ... // Remainder omitted } 
  Here are a few final caveats: • Always override hashCode when you override equals (Item 11). 
  • Don’t try to be too clever. If you simply test fields for equality, it’s not hard to adhere to the equals contract. If you are overly aggressive in searching for equivalence, it’s easy to get into trouble. It is generally a bad idea to take any form of aliasing into account. For example, the File class shouldn’t attempt to equate symbolic links referring to the same file. Thankfully, it doesn’t. 
  • Don’t substitute another type for Object in the equals declaration. It is not uncommon for a programmer to write an equals method that looks like this and then spend hours puzzling over why it doesn’t work properly: // Broken - parameter type must be Object! 
  public boolean equals(MyClass o) { ... 
  } 
  The problem is that this method does not override Object.equals, whose argument is of type Object, but overloads it instead (Item 52). It is unacceptable to provide such a “strongly typed” equals method even in addition to the normal one, because it can cause Override annotations in subclasses to generate false positives and provide a false sense of security. 
  Consistent use of the Override annotation, as illustrated throughout this item, will prevent you from making this mistake (Item 40). This equals method won’t compile, and the error message will tell you exactly what is wrong: // Still broken, but won’t compile @Override public boolean equals(MyClass o) { ... 
  } 
  Writing and testing equals (and hashCode) methods is tedious, and the resulting code is mundane. An excellent alternative to writing and testing these methods manually is to use Google’s open source AutoValue framework, which automatically generates these methods for you, triggered by a single annotation on the class . In most cases, the methods generated by AutoValue are essentially identical to those you’d write yourself. 
  IDEs, too, have facilities to generate equals and hashCode methods, but the resulting source code is more verbose and less readable than code that uses AutoValue, does not track changes in the class automatically, and therefore requires testing. That said, having IDEs generate equals (and hashCode) methods is generally preferable to implementing them manually because IDEs do not make careless mistakes, and humans do. 
  In summary, don’t override the equals method unless you have to: in many cases, the implementation inherited from Object does exactly what you want. If you do override equals, make sure to compare all of the class’s significant fields and to compare them in a manner that preserves all five provisions of the equals contract.
