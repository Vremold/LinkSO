  Prior to Java 8, it was impossible to add methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations. If you added a new method to an interface, existing implementations would, in general, lack the method, resulting in a compile-time error. In Java 8, the default method construct was added [JLS 9.4], with the intent of allowing the addition of methods to existing interfaces. But adding new methods to existing interfaces is fraught with risk. 
  The declaration for a default method includes a default implementation that is used by all classes that implement the interface but do not implement the default method. While the addition of default methods to Java makes it possible to add methods to an existing interface, there is no guarantee that these methods will work in all preexisting implementations. Default methods are “injected” into existing implementations without the knowledge or consent of their implementors. Before Java 8, these implementations were written with the tacit understanding that their interfaces would never acquire any new methods. 
  Many new default methods were added to the core collection interfaces in Java 8, primarily to facilitate the use of lambdas (Chapter 6). The Java libraries’ default methods are high-quality general-purpose implementations, and in most cases, they work fine. But it is not always possible to write a default method that maintains all invariants of every conceivable implementation. 
  For example, consider the removeIf method, which was added to the Collection interface in Java 8. This method removes all elements for which a given boolean function (or predicate) returns true. The default implementation is specified to traverse the collection using its iterator, invoking the predicate on each element, and using the iterator’s remove method to remove the elements for which the predicate returns true. Presumably the declaration looks something like this: // Default method added to the Collection interface in Java 8 default boolean removeIf(Predicate<? super E> filter) { Objects.requireNonNull(filter); 
  boolean result = false; 
  for (Iterator<E> it = iterator(); it.hasNext(); ) { if (filter.test(it.next())) { it.remove(); 
  result = true; 
  } 
  } 
  return result; 
  } 
  This is the best general-purpose implementation one could possibly write for the removeIf method, but sadly, it fails on some real-world Collection implementations. For example, consider org.apache.commons.collections4.collection.SynchronizedCollection. This class, from the Apache Commons library, is similar to the one returned by the static factory Collections.synchronizedCollection in java.util. The Apache version additionally provides the ability to use a client-supplied object for locking, in place of the collection. In other words, it is a wrapper class (Item 18), all of whose methods synchronize on a locking object before delegating to the wrapped collection. 
  The Apache SynchronizedCollection class is still being actively maintained, but as of this writing, it does not override the removeIf method. If this class is used in conjunction with Java 8, it will therefore inherit the default implementation of removeIf, which does not, indeed cannot, maintain the class’s fundamental promise: to automatically synchronize around each method invocation. The default implementation knows nothing about synchronization and has no access to the field that contains the locking object. If a client calls the removeIf method on a SynchronizedCollection instance in the presence of concurrent modification of the collection by another thread, a ConcurrentModificationException or other unspecified behavior may result. 
  In order to prevent this from happening in similar Java platform libraries implementations, such as the package-private class returned by Collections.synchronizedCollection, the JDK maintainers had to override the default removeIf implementation and other methods like it to perform the necessary synchronization before invoking the default implementation. Preexisting collection implementations that were not part of the Java platform did not have the opportunity to make analogous changes in lockstep with the interface change, and some have yet to do so. 
  In the presence of default methods, existing implementations of an interface may compile without error or warning but fail at runtime. While not terribly common, this problem is not an isolated incident either. A handful of the methods added to the collections interfaces in Java 8 are known to be susceptible, and a handful of existing implementations are known to be affected. 
  Using default methods to add new methods to existing interfaces should be avoided unless the need is critical, in which case you should think long and hard about whether an existing interface implementation might be broken by your default method implementation. Default methods are, however, extremely useful for providing standard method implementations when an interface is created, to ease the task of implementing the interface (Item 20). 
  It is also worth noting that default methods were not designed to support removing methods from interfaces or changing the signatures of existing methods. 
  Neither of these interface changes is possible without breaking existing clients. 
  The moral is clear. Even though default methods are now a part of the Java platform, it is still of the utmost importance to design interfaces with great care. While default methods make it possible to add methods to existing interfaces, there is great risk in doing so. If an interface contains a minor flaw, it may irritate its users forever; if an interface is severely deficient, it may doom the API that contains it. 
  Therefore, it is critically important to test each new interface before you release it. Multiple programmers should implement each interface in different ways. At a minimum, you should aim for three diverse implementations. Equally important is to write multiple client programs that use instances of each new interface to perform various tasks. This will go a long way toward ensuring that each interface satisfies all of its intended uses. These steps will allow you to discover flaws in interfaces before they are released, when you can still correct them easily. While it may be possible to correct some interface flaws after an interface is released, you cannot count on it.
