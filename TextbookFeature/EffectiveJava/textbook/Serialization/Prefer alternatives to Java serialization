  When serialization was added to Java in 1997, it was known to be somewhat risky. 
  The approach had been tried in a research language (Modula-3) but never in a production language. While the promise of distributed objects with little effort on the part of the programmer was appealing, the price was invisible constructors and blurred lines between API and implementation, with the potential for problems with correctness, performance, security, and maintenance. Proponents believed the benefits outweighed the risks, but history has shown otherwise. 
  The security issues described in previous editions of this book turned out to be every bit as serious as some had feared. The vulnerabilities discussed in the early 2000s were transformed into serious exploits over the next decade, famously including a ransomware attack on the San Francisco Metropolitan Transit Agency Municipal Railway (SFMTA Muni) that shut down the entire fare collection system for two days in November 2016 [Gallagher16]. 
  A fundamental problem with serialization is that its attack surface is too big to protect, and constantly growing: Object graphs are deserialized by invoking the readObject method on an ObjectInputStream. This method is essentially a magic constructor that can be made to instantiate objects of almost any type on the class path, so long as the type implements the Serializable interface. In the process of deserializing a byte stream, this method can execute code from any of these types, so the code for all of these types is part of the attack surface. 
  The attack surface includes classes in the Java platform libraries, in third-party libraries such as Apache Commons Collections, and in the application itself. Even if you adhere to all of the relevant best practices and succeed in writing serializable classes that are invulnerable to attack, your application may still be vulnerable. To quote Robert Seacord, technical manager of the CERT Coordination Center: Java deserialization is a clear and present danger as it is widely used both directly by applications and indirectly by Java subsystems such as RMI (Remote Method Invocation), JMX (Java Management Extension), and JMS (Java Messaging System). Deserialization of untrusted streams can result in remote code execution (RCE), denial-of-service (DoS), and a range of other exploits. Applications can be vulnerable to these attacks even if they did nothing wrong. [Seacord17] Attackers and security researchers study the serializable types in the Java libraries and in commonly used third-party libraries, looking for methods invoked during deserialization that perform potentially dangerous activities. Such methods are known as gadgets. Multiple gadgets can be used in concert, to form a gadget chain. From time to time, a gadget chain is discovered that is sufficiently powerful to allow an attacker to execute arbitrary native code on the underlying hardware, given only the opportunity to submit a carefully crafted byte stream for deserialization. This is exactly what happened in the SFMTA Muni attack. This attack was not isolated. There have been others, and there will be more. 
  Without using any gadgets, you can easily mount a denial-of-service attack by causing the deserialization of a short stream that requires a long time to deserialize. Such streams are known as deserialization bombs [Svoboda16]. Here’s an example by Wouter Coekaerts that uses only hash sets and a string [Coekaerts15]: // Deserialization bomb - deserializing this stream takes forever static byte[] bomb() { Set<Object> root = new HashSet<>(); 
  Set<Object> s1 = root; 
  Set<Object> s2 = new HashSet<>(); 
  for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) { Set<Object> t1 = new HashSet<>(); 
  Set<Object> t2 = new HashSet<>(); 
  t1.add("foo"); // Make t1 unequal to t2 s1.add(t1); s1.add(t2); 
  s2.add(t1); s2.add(t2); 
  s1 = t1; 
  s2 = t2; 
  } 
  return serialize(root); // Method omitted for brevity } 
  The object graph consists of 201 HashSet instances, each of which contains 3 or fewer object references. The entire stream is 5,744 bytes long, yet the sun would burn out long before you could deserialize it. The problem is that deserializing a HashSet instance requires computing the hash codes of its elements. The 2 elements of the root hash set are themselves hash sets containing 2 hash-set elements, each of which contains 2 hash-set elements, and so on, 100 levels deep. Therefore, deserializing the set causes the hashCode method to be invoked over 2100 times. Other than the fact that the deserialization is taking forever, the deserializer has no indication that anything is amiss. Few objects are produced, and the stack depth is bounded. 
  So what can you do defend against these problems? You open yourself up to attack whenever you deserialize a byte stream that you don’t trust. The best way to avoid serialization exploits is never to deserialize anything. In the words of the computer named Joshua in the 1983 movie WarGames, “the only winning move is not to play.” There is no reason to use Java serialization in any new system you write. There are other mechanisms for translating between objects and byte sequences that avoid many of the dangers of Java serialization, while offering numerous advantages, such as cross-platform support, high performance, a large ecosystem of tools, and a broad community of expertise. In this book, we refer to these mechanisms as cross-platform structured-data representations. 
  While others sometimes refer to them as serialization systems, this book avoids that usage to prevent confusion with Java serialization. 
  What these representations have in common is that they’re far simpler than Java serialization. They don’t support automatic serialization and deserialization of arbitrary object graphs. Instead, they support simple, structured data-objects consisting of a collection of attribute-value pairs. Only a few primitive and array data types are supported. This simple abstraction turns out to be sufficient for building extremely powerful distributed systems and simple enough to avoid the serious problems that have plagued Java serialization since its inception. 
  The leading cross-platform structured data representations are JSON [JSON] and Protocol Buffers, also known as protobuf [Protobuf]. JSON was designed by Douglas Crockford for browser-server communication, and protocol buffers were designed by Google for storing and interchanging structured data among its servers. Even though these representations are sometimes called language-neutral, JSON was originally developed for JavaScript and protobuf for C++; both representations retain vestiges of their origins. 
  The most significant differences between JSON and protobuf are that JSON is text-based and human-readable, whereas protobuf is binary and substantially more efficient; and that JSON is exclusively a data representation, whereas protobuf offers schemas (types) to document and enforce appropriate usage. Although protobuf is more efficient than JSON, JSON is extremely efficient for a text-based representation. And while protobuf is a binary representation, it does provide an alternative text representation for use where human-readability is desired (pbtxt). 
  If you can’t avoid Java serialization entirely, perhaps because you’re working in the context of a legacy system that requires it, your next best alternative is to never deserialize untrusted data. In particular, you should never accept RMI traffic from untrusted sources. The official secure coding guidelines for Java say “Deserialization of untrusted data is inherently dangerous and should be avoided.” This sentence is set in large, bold, italic, red type, and it is the only text in the entire document that gets this treatment [Java-secure]. 
  If you can’t avoid serialization and you aren’t absolutely certain of the safety of the data you’re deserializing, use the object deserialization filtering added in Java 9 and backported to earlier releases (java.io.ObjectInputFilter). This facility lets you specify a filter that is applied to data streams before they’re deserialized. It operates at the class granularity, letting you accept or reject certain classes. Accepting classes by default and rejecting a list of potentially dangerous ones is known as blacklisting; rejecting classes by default and accepting a list of those that are presumed safe is known as whitelisting. Prefer whitelisting to blacklisting, as blacklisting only protects you against known threats. A tool called Serial Whitelist Application Trainer (SWAT) can be used to automatically prepare a whitelist for your application [Schneider16]. The filtering facility will also protect you against excessive memory usage, and excessively deep object graphs, but it will not protect you against serialization bombs like the one shown above. 
  Unfortunately, serialization is still pervasive in the Java ecosystem. If you are maintaining a system that is based on Java serialization, seriously consider migrating to a cross-platform structured-data representation, even though this may be a time-consuming endeavor. Realistically, you may still find yourself having to write or maintain a serializable class. It requires great care to write a serializable class that is correct, safe, and efficient. The remainder of this chapter provides advice on when and how to do this. 
  In summary, serialization is dangerous and should be avoided. If you are designing a system from scratch, use a cross-platform structured-data representation such as JSON or protobuf instead. Do not deserialize untrusted data. If you must do so, use object deserialization filtering, but be aware that it is not guaranteed to thwart all attacks. Avoid writing serializable classes. If you must do so, exercise great caution.
