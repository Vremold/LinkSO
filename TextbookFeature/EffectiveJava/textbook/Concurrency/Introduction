  THREADS allow multiple activities to proceed concurrently. Concurrent programming is harder than single-threaded programming, because more things can go wrong, and failures can be hard to reproduce. You canâ€™t avoid concurrency.

This chapter contains advice to help you write clear, correct, well-documented concurrent programs.
