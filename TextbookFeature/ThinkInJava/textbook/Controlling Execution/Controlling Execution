  Like a sentient creature, a program must manipulate its world and make choices during execution. In Java you make choices with execution control statements. 
  Java uses all of C’s execution control statements, so if you’ve programmed with C or C++, then most of what you see will be familiar. Most procedural programming languages have some kind of control statements, and there is often overlap among languages. In Java, the keywords include if-else, while, do-while, for, return, break, and a selection statement called switch. Java does not, however, support the much-maligned goto (which can still be the most expedient way to solve certain types of problems). You can still do a goto-like jump, but it is much more constrained than a typical goto.
