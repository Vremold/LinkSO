  All conditional statements use the truth or falsehood of a conditional expression to determine the execution path. An example of a conditional expression is a == b. This uses the conditional operator == to see if the value of a is equivalent to the value of b. The expression returns true or false. Any of the relational operators you’ve seen in the previous chapter can be used to produce a conditional statement. Note that Java doesn’t allow you to use a number as a boolean, even though it’s allowed in C and C++ (where truth is nonzero and falsehood is zero). If you want to use a non-boolean in a boolean test, such as if(a), you must first convert it to a boolean value by using a conditional expression, such as if(a != 0).
