  My company, MindView, Inc., provides five-day, hands-on, public and in-house training seminars based on the material in this book. Formerly called the Hands-On Java seminar, this is our main introductory seminar that provides the foundation for our more advanced seminars. Selected material from each chapter represents a lesson, which is followed by a monitored exercise period so that each student receives personal attention. You can find schedule and location information, testimonials, and details at www.MindView.net.
