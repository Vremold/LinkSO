  The Hands-On Java CD contains an extended version of the material from the Thinking in Java seminar and is based on this book. It provides at least some of the experience of the live seminar without the travel and expense. There is an audio lecture and slides corresponding to every chapter in the book. I created the seminar and I narrate the material on the CD. The material is in Flash format, so it should run on any platform that supports the Flash Player. The Hands-On Java CD is for sale at www.MindView.net, where you can find trial demos of the product.
