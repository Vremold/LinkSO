  The code for this book is available for download from www.MindView.net. This includes the Ant build files and other support files necessary to do a successful build and execution of all the examples in the book. 
  In addition, a few portions of the book were moved to electronic form. The subjects include: 
  • Cloning Objects  • Passing & Returning Objects 
  • Analysis and Design  • Portions of other chapters from Thinking in Java, 3rd Edition that were not relevant enough to put in the print version of the 4th edition of this book.
