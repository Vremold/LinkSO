  This seminar introduces the ideas of object-oriented programming from the standpoint of the designer. It explores the process of developing and building a system, primarily focusing on socalled “Agile Methods” or “Lightweight Methodologies,” especially Extreme Programming (XP). I introduce methodologies in general, small tools like the “index-card” planning techniques described in Planning Extreme Programming by Beck and Fowler (Addison-Wesley, 2001), CRC cards for object design, pair programming, iteration planning, unit testing, automated building, source-code control, and similar topics. The course includes an XP project that will be developed throughout the week. 
  If you are starting a project and would like to begin using object-oriented design techniques, we can use your project as the example and produce a first-cut design by the end of the week.
