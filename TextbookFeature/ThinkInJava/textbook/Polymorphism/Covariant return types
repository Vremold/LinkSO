  Java SE5 adds covariant return types, which means that an overridden method in a derived class can return a type derived from the type returned by the base-class method: 
  The key difference between Java SE5 and earlier versions of java is that the earlier versions would force the overridden version of process( ) to return Grain, rather than Wheat, even though Wheat is derived from Grain and thus is still a legitimate return type. Covariant return types allow the more specific Wheat return type.
