  When Java first appeared, much of the brouhaha around the language came from the applet, a program that can be delivered across the Internet to run (inside a so-called sandbox, for security) in a Web browser. People foresaw the Java applet as the next stage in the evolution of the Internet, and many of the original books on Java assumed that the reason you were interested in the language was that you wanted to write applets. 
  For various reasons, this revolution never happened. A large part of the problem was that most machines don’t include the necessary Java software to run applets, and downloading and installing a 10 MB package in order to run something you’ve casually encountered on the Web is not something most users are willing to do. Many users are even frightened by the idea. Java applets as a client-side application delivery system never achieved critical mass, and although you will still occasionally see an applet, they have generally been relegated to the backwaters of computing. 
  This doesn’t mean that applets are not an interesting and valuable technology. If you are in a situation where you can ensure that users have a JRE installed (such as inside a corporate environment), then applets (or JNLP/Java Web Start, described later in this chapter) might be the perfect way to distribute client programs and automatically update everyone’s machine without the usual cost and effort of distributing and installing new software. 
  You’ll find an introduction to the technology of applets in the online supplements to this book at www.MindView.net.
