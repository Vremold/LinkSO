  In C and C++, the sizeof( ) operator tells you the number of bytes allocated for data items. The most compelling reason for sizeof( ) in C and C++ is for portability. Different data types might be different sizes on different machines, so the programmer must discover how big those types are when performing operations that are sensitive to size. For example, one computer might store integers in 32 bits, whereas another might store integers as 16 bits. Programs could store larger values in integers on the first machine. As you might imagine, portability is a huge headache for C and C++ programmers. 
  Java does not need a sizeof( ) operator for this purpose, because all the data types are the same size on all machines. You do not need to think about portability on this levelâ€”it is designed into the language.
