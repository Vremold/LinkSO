  At the lowest level, data in Java is manipulated using operators. 
  Because Java was inherited from C++, most of these operators will be familiar to C and C++ programmers. Java has also added some improvements and simplifications. 
  If youâ€™re familiar with C or C++ syntax, you can skim through this chapter and the next, looking for places where Java is different from those languages. However, if you find yourself floundering a bit in these two chapters, make sure you go through the multimedia seminar Thinking in C, freely downloadable from www.MindView.net. It contains audio lectures, slides, exercises, and solutions specifically designed to bring you up to speed with the fundamentals necessary to learn Java.
