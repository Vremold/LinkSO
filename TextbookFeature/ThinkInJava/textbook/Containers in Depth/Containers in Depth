  The Holding Your Objects chapter introduced the ideas and basic functionality of the Java containers library, and is enough to get you started using containers. This chapter explores this important library more deeply. 
  In order to get full use of the containers library, you need to know more than what was introduced in Holding Your Objects, but this chapter relies on advanced material (like generics) so it was delayed until later in the book. 
  After a more complete overview of containers, you’ll learn how hashing works, and how to write hashCode( ) and equals( ) to work with hashed containers. You’ll learn why there are different versions of some containers and how to choose between them. The chapter finishes with an exploration of general-purpose utilities and special classes.
