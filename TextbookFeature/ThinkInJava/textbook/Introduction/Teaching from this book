  The original edition of this book evolved from a one-week seminar which was, when Java was in its infancy, enough time to cover the language. As Java grew and continued to encompass more and more features and libraries, I stubbornly tried to teach it all in one week. At one point, a customer asked me to teach “just the fundamentals,” and in doing so I discovered that trying to cram everything into a single week had become painful for both myself and for seminarians. Java was no longer a “simple” language that could be taught in a week. 
  That experience and realization drove much of the reorganization of this book, which is now designed to support a two-week seminar or a two-term college course. The introductory portion ends with the Error Handling with Exceptions chapter, but you may also want to supplement this with an introduction to JDBC, Servlets and JSPs. This provides a foundation course, and is the core of the Hands-On Java CD ROM. The remainder of the book comprises an intermediatelevel course, and is the material covered in the Intermediate Thinking in Java CD ROM. Both of these CD ROMs are for sale at www.MindView.net.
