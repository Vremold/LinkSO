  Another bonus with this edition is the free multimedia seminar that you can download from www.MindView.net. This is the Thinking in C seminar that gives you an introduction to the C syntax, operators, and functions that Java syntax is based upon. In previous editions of the book this was in the Foundations for Java CD that was packaged with the book, but now the seminar may be freely downloaded. 
  I originally commissioned Chuck Allison to create Thinking in C as a standalone product, but decided to include it with the 2nd edition of Thinking in C++ and 2nd and 3rd editions of Thinking in Java because of the consistent experience of having people come to seminars without an adequate background in basic C syntax. The thinking apparently goes “I’m a smart programmer and I don’t want to learn C, but rather C++ or Java, so I’ll just skip C and go directly to C++/Java.” After arriving at the seminar, it slowly dawns on folks that the prerequisite of understanding C syntax is there for a very good reason. 
  Technologies have changed, and it made more sense to rework Thinking in C as a downloadable Flash presentation rather than including it as a CD. By providing this seminar online, I can ensure that everyone can begin with adequate preparation. 
  The Thinking in C seminar also allows the book to appeal to a wider audience. Even though the Operators and Controlling Execution chapters do cover the fundamental parts of Java that come from C, the online seminar is a gentler introduction, and assumes even less about the student’s programming background than does the book.
