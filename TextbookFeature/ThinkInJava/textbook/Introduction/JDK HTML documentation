  The Java language and libraries from Sun Microsystems (a free download from http://java.sun.com) come with documentation in electronic form, readable using a Web browser. Many books published on Java have duplicated this documentation. So you either already have it or you can download it, and unless necessary, this book will not repeat that documentation, because it’s usually much faster if you find the class descriptions with your Web browser than if you look them up in a book (and the online documentation is probably more upto-date). You’ll simply be referred to “the JDK documentation.” This book will provide extra descriptions of the classes only when it’s necessary to supplement that documentation so you can understand a particular example.
