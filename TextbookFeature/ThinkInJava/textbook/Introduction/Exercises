  I’ve discovered that simple exercises are exceptionally useful to complete a student’s understanding during a seminar, so you’ll find a set at the end of each chapter. 
  Most exercises are designed to be easy enough that they can be finished in a reasonable amount of time in a classroom situation while the instructor observes, making sure that all the students are absorbing the material. Some are more challenging, but none present major challenges. 
  Solutions to selected exercises can be found in the electronic document The Thinking in Java Annotated Solution Guide, available for sale from www.MindView.net.
