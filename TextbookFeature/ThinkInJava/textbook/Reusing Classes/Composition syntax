  Composition has been used quite frequently up to this point in the book. You simply place object references inside new classes. For example, suppose you’d like an object that holds several String objects, a couple of primitives, and an object of another class. For the non- primitive objects, you put references inside your new class, but you define the primitives directly: 
  Note that in the Bath constructor, a statement is executed before any of the initializations take place. When you don’t initialize at the point of definition, there’s still no guarantee that you’ll perform any initialization before you send a message to an object reference—except for the inevitable run-time exception. 
  When toString( ) is called it fills in s4 so that all the fields are properly initialized by the time they are used. 
  Exercise 1: (2) Create a simple class. Inside a second class, define a reference to an object of the first class. Use lazy initialization to instantiate this object.
