  Is an Object  “If we spoke a different language, we would perceive a somewhat different world.” Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951) 
  Although it is based on C++, Java is more of a “pure” object-oriented language. 
  Both C++ and Java are hybrid languages, but in Java the designers felt that the hybridization was not as important as it was in C++. A hybrid language allows multiple programming styles; the reason C++ is hybrid is to support backward compatibility with the C language. Because C++ is a superset of the C language, it includes many of that language’s undesirable features, which can make some aspects of C++ overly complicated. 
  The Java language assumes that you want to do only object-oriented programming. This means that before you can begin you must shift your mindset into an object-oriented world (unless it’s already there). The benefit of this initial effort is the ability to program in a language that is simpler to learn and to use than many other OOP languages. In this chapter you’ll see the basic components of a Java program and learn that (almost) everything in Java is an object.
