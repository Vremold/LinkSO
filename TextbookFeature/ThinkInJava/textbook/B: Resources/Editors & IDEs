  There is a healthy competition in this arena. Many offerings are free (and the non-free ones usually have free trials), so your best bet is to simply try them out yourself and see which one fits your needs. Here are a few: 
  JEdit, Slava Pestovâ€™s free editor, is written in Java, so you get the bonus of seeing a desktop Java application in action. This editor is based heavily on plug-ins, many of which have been written by the active community. Download from www.jedit.org. 
  NetBeans, a free IDE from Sun, at www.netbeans.org. Designed for drag-and-drop GUI building, code editing, debugging, and more. 
  Eclipse, an open-source project backed by IBM, among others. The Eclipse platform is also designed to be an extensible foundation, so you can build your own standalone applications on top of Eclipse. This project created the SWT described in the Graphical User Interfaces chapter. Download from www.Eclipse.org. 
  IntelliJ IDEA, the payware favorite of a large faction of Java programmers, many of whom claim that IDEA is always a step or two ahead of Eclipse, possibly because IntelliJ is not creating both an IDE and a development platform, but just sticking to creating an IDE. You can download a free trial from www.jetbrains.com.
