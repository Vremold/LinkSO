  The first release of Java in 1996 generated an incredible amount of excitement, not just in the computer press, but in mainstream media such as the New York Times, the Washington Post, and BusinessWeek. Java has the distinction of being the first and only programming language that had a ten-minute story on National Public Radio. A $100,000,000 venture capital fund was set up solely for products using a specific computer language. I hope you will enjoy a brief history of Java that you will find in this chapter.
