  Comments in Java, as in most programming languages, do not show up in the executable program. Thus, you can add as many comments as needed without fear of bloating the code. Java has three ways of marking comments. The most common form is a //. Use this for a comment that runs from the // to the end of the line. 
  System.out.println("We will not use 'Hello, World!'"); // is this too cute? 
  When longer comments are needed, you can mark each line with a //, or you can use the /* and */ comment delimiters that let you block off a longer comment. 
  Finally, a third kind of comment is used to generate documentation automatically. This comment uses a /** to start and a */ to end. You can see this type of comment in Listing 3.1. For more on this type of comment and on automatic documentation generation, see Chapter 4. 
  Caution /* */ comments do not nest in Java. That is, you might not be able to deactivate code simply by surrounding it with /* and */ because the code you want to deactivate might itself contain a */ delimiter.
