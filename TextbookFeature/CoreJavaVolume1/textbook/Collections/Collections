  The data structures that you choose can make a big difference when you try to implement methods in a natural style or are concerned with performance. Do you need to search quickly through thousands (or even millions) of sorted items? Do you need to rapidly insert and remove elements in the middle of an ordered sequence? Do you need to establish associations between keys and values?
  This chapter shows how the Java library can help you accomplish the traditional data structuring needed for serious programming. In college computer science programs, a course called Data Structures usually takes a semester to complete, and there are many, many books devoted to this important topic. Our coverage differs from that of a college course; we will skip the theory and just show you how to use the collection classes in the standard library.
