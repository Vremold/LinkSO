  In this chapter, you will learn how to install the Java Development Kit (JDK) and how to compile and run various types of programs: console programs, graphical applications, and applets. You can run the JDK tools by typing commands in a terminal window. However, many programmers prefer the comfort of an integrated development environment. You will learn how to use a freely available development environment to compile and run Java programs. Once you have mastered the techniques in this chapter and picked your development tools, you are ready to move on to Chapter 3, where you will begin exploring the Java programming language.
