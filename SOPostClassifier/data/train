How would you access Object properties from within an object method?,"What is the ""purist"" or ""correct"" way to access an object's properties from within an object method that is not a getter/setter method?I know that from outside of the object you should use a getter/setter, but from within would you just do:Java:PHP:or would you do:Java:PHP:Forgive me if my Java is a little off, it's been a year since I programmed in Java...EDIT:It seems people are assuming I am talking about private or protected variables/properties only. When I learned OO I was taught to use getters/setters for every single property even if it was public (and actually I was told never to make any variable/property public). So, I may be starting off from a false assumption from the get go. It appears that people answering this question are maybe saying that you should have public properties and that those don't need getters and setters, which goes against what I was taught, and what I was talking about, although maybe that needs to be discussed as well. That's probably a good topic for a different question though...",0

Caching Strategies with Paged/Filtered Data,"I am currently thinking about Caching Strategies and more importantly avoiding any duplication of data inside the cache.  My query is kind of language agnostic but very much programming related.My question is regarding the efficient caching of paged or filtered data but more than that, distributed caching.  The latter I have decided to go with memcached and more specifically a  .NET port of it.  I have seen another commercial option in the form of NCache, but memcached seems perfectly acceptable to me and apparently is used on facebook, myspace etc...My query then is a strategy my which you can contain objects in cache and also a reference to them with paged data.  If I have 100 items and I page them, then I could cache the ids of product 1-10 inside the cache and cache each product seperately.  If I where to sort the items descending then items 1-10 would be different products so I would not want to store the actual objects each time the paged data/sorting/filtering changed, but instead stored the ids of the objects so I could then perform a trabsactional lookup in the databse if some of them do not already exist in the cache or are invalid.My initial idea was this for a cache key.I would then iterate through the cache keys and remove any which start with ""paged_""  My question ultimately is if any one knows of any patterns or ideas about straties regarding caching of such patterns of data such as paged data and also making sure that objects are not cached more than once.memcached is native code and would not have a problem clearing the cache in the way I have stated above, but it is an obvious fact that the more items in the cache the more time it would take.

How can I cache the marshalled SOAP XML generated by Apache CXF for a particular Java Object to improve performance?,"In my application, we have a webservice method called getFoo() which returns a Foo object.  The getFoo() method is called several hundred times a second.  The Foo object is Marshalled from our Java object to the SOAP XML response using Apache CXF.  From profiling our application, we determined that the marshalling of this object (java object -> soap encoded xml) is the single greatest consumer of CPU cycles. and since our Foo object isn't changing very often, remarshalling this object each time is unnecessary.I figured this is a common optimization and wondered how others have addressed it.I briefly looked at the CXF docs and there is a Marshall interceptor which I could probably make use of.  I could create a Map which could map Foo objects to the XML encoded version.  But, then a few other issues come up like how do you remove objects from this Map once they are no longer needed etc.  It'd be nice if there was built in support for somehow detecting changes to the object and re-marshalling... Nothing impossible, but didn't want to reinvent the wheel.EDIT (6/16/09): Have made some progress by making a custom BareOutInterceptor and modifying the Interceptor chain to call the custom one.  The custom adds some additional logic to only call the ""writeParts(....)"" method which performs the marshalling only the once for a given java object.  Will post solution once finished.  Also, I renamed the question.",1

So, I basically have multiple  ""transition on"" statements for the various event. So far so good. The problem occurs when I perform multiple ""evaluate expressions"" within each of these transitions. I get very unpredictable results. It almost seems that sometime only the first evaluate gets executed and my app hangs. The samples and documentation I've referenced are very simple in nature. Generally, they don't evaluate expressions with transitions. However, I need to set up variables specific to the screen I'm going to.I know there are action and decision state tags, but I run into similiar problems when I insert multple ""expression evaluates.""Can anyone offer any insights on how to what I'm trying to accomplish?For the record, I'm working on a new project where most of the people are new to web development. We're ""refreshing"" our major product from an older, client server architecture to a new web based version. So, I have no resources here to go to help. The 2 people here who supposedly know a little about web flow seem stumped too. I suspect when I was told to just ""use their sample code"" I am attempting to emulate code from people who weren't sure of what they were doing either.ThanksFrank ",1
Change text on button in eclipse header on the fly,"I'm creating a view in eclipse to display stack traces, and I want to have the view accessible from a button in the header. So I'm creating an extension using the plugin.xml framework, like this basically:This will create a button with ""0 traces"" as the text.

Basically I just need to be able to edit the button in the header in a Java file, rather than in the plugin.xml file. But I have no idea how to do this! I've looked through the eclipse SDK help but haven't found anything. Please help!I'm also open to any other way to make this happen in an application built on eclipse, so long as the text changes and clicking the text opens a view.",0
How can I cancel a long-running query using Spring and JDBCTemplate?,"The JDBC java.sql.Statement class has a cancel() method.

OCL Syntax Checker,"I have been looking for an existing open-source syntax-checker for the Object Constraint Language (OCL). I intend to extend the syntax-checker with additional functionality not present in the OCL standard to be more applicable to my usage with entity-relationship diagrams. However, most of the projects I have found are based on the Eclipse Meta-Object Facility (MOF), while I seek only the ability to verify the grammar of an OCL expression (completely independent of any associated class diagrams, etc.). I have begun looking into the source of the Dresden OCL Toolkit (dresden-ocl.sourceforge.net), even though the newest toolkit is also intended for use with the Eclipse MOF. Unfortunately, all downloads are blocked at the company I work for, and it takes 1-2 days minimum to get permission for any download, so I want to know if anyone might be able to point me in the right direction to find what I am looking for.Thank you very much in advance.Best regards,Shona",0

Grab entire document tree with OpenOffice API,"I would like to grab the entire tree for a [Writer](""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenOffice.org_Writer"") document in [OpenOffice](""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenOffice.org"") 3.1. I need to collect data on all the elements in the tree, not only the Text elements.By loading the XTextDocument and doing getText() will give the XText element. More specifically, using an XEnumerationAccess from the XText will only iterate over the TextRange.From the OpenOffice documentation [/DevGuide/Text/Iterating_over_Text](""http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/DevGuide/Text/Iterating_over_Text""):  The second interface of com.sun.star.text.Text is XEnumerationAccess. A Text service enumerates all paragraphs in a text and returns objects which support com.sun.star.text.Paragraph. This includes tables, because writer sees tables as specialized paragraphs that support the com.sun.star.text.TextTable service.Some additional documentation here:  The text portion enumeration of a paragraph does not supply contents which do belong to the paragraph, but do not fuse together with the text flow. These could be text frames, graphic objects, embedded objects or drawing shapes anchored at the paragraph, characters or as character. The TextPortionType ""TextContent"" indicate if there is a content anchored at a character or as a character. If you have a TextContent portion type, you know that there are shape objects anchored at a character or as a character.My test documents indicate that I do get a [XTextContent](""http://api.openoffice.org/docs/common/ref/com/sun/star/text/XTextContent.html"") and the [XTextRange](""http://api.openoffice.org/docs/common/ref/com/sun/star/text/XTextRange.html"") can be collected via getAnchor(). But how can I determine the type of content that I am collecting? The only method is getString(). If the object was an embedded image, how do I collect its data?I am using C++ but I believe a solution in Java would be portable.Migrated From AnswerDue to poor formatting, this comment is posted as an answer.Thanks for your response.I intend to use the API.I am trying the example of collecting GrahicObjects from the document. By using a XGraphicObjectsSupplier I can get a collection via getGraphicObjects(). The object from the collection is Any and printing the type via getValueTypeName() gives XTextContent.

So I guess the error has to be somewhere in the rendering process.This is the source code responsible for the whole rendering and printing process:Another fun fact: The screwing up of PDF's only happens on the created iText PDF documents. If I try to print some random other PDF it does not get mangled.Any ideas about what the problem could be? And how can the rendering affect my PDF's at all? As I understand this scource code, the READ_ONLY mode should prevent exactly that...EDIT: I just saw that printing an iText created PDF also removes the embedded fonts. Again, before rendering/printing via pdf-renderer this worked perfectly fine. (Fonts also showed up in the PDF properties, etc. ...)",1
How to split up complex conditions and keep short circuit evaluation?,"Sometimes conditions can become quite complex, so for readability I usually split them up and give each component a meaningful name. This defeats short-circuit evaluation however, which can pose a problem. I came up with a wrapper approach, but it is way too verbose in my opinion. Can anybody come up with a neat solution for this?See code below for examples of what I mean:Response to answers:Thanks for all your ideas! The following alternatives were submitted so far:Break lines and add commentsLeave as isExtract methodsEarly returnsNested / Split up if'sBreak lines and add comments:Just adding linebreaks within a condition gets undone by the code formatter in Eclipse (ctrl+shift+f). Inline comments helps with this, but leaves little space on each line and can result in ugly wrapping. In simple cases this might be enough however.Leave as is:The example condition I gave is quite simplistic, so you might not need to address readability issues in this case. I was thinking of situations where the condition is much more complex, for example:I would not recommend leaving this as it is.    Extract methods:I considered extracting methods, as was suggested in several answers. The disadvantage of that is that these methods typically have a very low granularity and may not be very meaningful by themselves, so it can clutter your class, for example:This would not really deserve to be a separate method at class level. Also you have to pass all the relevant arguments to each method. If you create a separate class purely for evaluating a very complex condition then this might be an ok solution IMO.What I tried to achieve with the BooleanExpression approach is that the logic remains local. Notice that even the declaration of BooleanExpression is local (I don't think I've ever come across a use-case for a local class declaration before!).Early returns:The early returns solution seems adequate, even though I don't favor the idiom. An alternative notation:I realize most people hate labels and breaks, and this style might be too uncommon to be considered readable.Nested/split up if's:It allows the introduction of meaningful names in combination with optimized evaluation. A drawback is the complex tree of conditional statements that can ensueShowdownSo to see which approach I utlimately favor, I applied several of the suggested solutions to the complex targetFound example presented above. Here are my results:nested / split if's, with meaningful namesvery verbose, meaningful names don't really help the readability here nested / split if's, with commentsless verbose, but still hard to read and easy to create bugsearly returnseven more compact, but the conditional tree remains just as complexextracted methodsresults in nonsensical methods in your classthe parameter passing is annoyingBooleanExpression wrappers revisitednote that the method parameters must be declared finalfor this complex case the verbosity is defendable IMOMaybe closures will make this easier, if they ever agree on that (-I guess it really depends on the situation (as always). For very complex conditions the wrapper approach might be defendable, although it is uncommon. Thanks for all your input!EDIT: afterthought. It might be even better to create a specific class for complex logic such as this:The logic is complex enough to warrant a separate class (and unit test, yay!). It will keep the code using this logic more readable and promotes reuse in case this logic is needed elsewhere. I think this is a nice class because it truely has a single responsibility and only final fields.",1

You have been asked to write a program  to grade the results of a true-false  quiz and display the results in  tabular form. The quiz consists of 10  questions. The data file for this  problem consists of 1 set of correct  responses (answerkey) on line one and  succeeding lines containing a four  digit student identification number  followed by that student's 10  responses. (The number of students  taking the quiz in currently unknown.)    The data file is in the form :    TFFTFTTFTT    0461 TTFTTFTFTT    3218 TFFTTTTTFT    .....................    ....................    Your program should read the key and  store it in a one dimensional array.  It should then read and process each  succeeding line, storing the student  identification numbers in a one  dimensional array and the grades in  two separate one dimensional arrays-  one for numeric grades and the for  letter grades.    Numeric grades are converted to letter  according to the following system :  A(10), B(9), C(8-7), D (6-5), F(4-0).    Program output should include the  following :      Each Student's four digit identification number, their numeric  grade and their letter grade.  A printed count of how many students took the quiz.  The numeric quiz average for the entire class.  A frequency count of the number of A's, B's, C's,D's and F's for the  entire class.  EDIT:Oh, hey. Sorry, I am still getting the hang of how to do all of this :(  Alright, here goes.The program is not compiling, and I am pretty sure it's down to my logic. (As well as some syntactical stuff).What I'm having trouble with:1) How to pass all of the parameters to each of the different methods, as seen here. What I would LIKE to do is have all of my values that I return such as answerKey, studentAnswers, numericGrade, average etc be up here so that I can use them and print them. But I do not know how to do that.2) I cannot figure out how to individually check through each of the T or F values and check if it corresponds with the T or F in the answer key, as seen below.What I am trying to do is to check through each letter at a specific element, and if the value is ""correct"" or == to answerKey, then add to the total in numericGrade for that element.3) I do not know how to return all of these different values, as I need them all above! I want this set of code to check the letter grade of each element and if this element is found, ++ the variable that corresponds to it, so I know how many of this letter grade was called.4) I can't figure this out... I think I am close. Here, I am trying to read the file, tokenize it, and then for each token, add it to the array 1 by 1. However, I don't think that's it's doing that properly, but I can't check since I can't get it to compile...I am now done editing my post. I hope this is sufficient :)",1

I need that because of the following problem.A new JPanel appears appears when I want (either time limit is exceeded or user press the ""Submit"" button). But in several seconds some element of the old JPanel appears together with the component of the new JPanel. I do not understand why it happens.I thought that it is because I have to other threads which update the window. But the first thread just add the old panel once (so, it should be finished). And in the second thread I have a loop which is broken (so, it also should be finished).Here is my code:",1

How to run integration tests?,"In our project, we have a plenty of unit tests. They help to keep project rather well-tested.Besides them, we have a set of tests which are unit tests but depends on some kind of external resource. We call them external tests.

Also, these tests can take too much time to run.Currently, we keep integration/external unit tests just to run them when developing corresponding functionality.For plain unit tests, we use TeamCity for continuous integration.How do you run the integration unit tests and when do you run them?",1

For example, I am contractor, hired to rescue some project very quickly. Fix bugs, plan global refactoring and therefore I need most efficient way to understand the code.

Of what I know: reverse code engineering to create object models (creating of diagram per package is not so convenient), create sequence diagrams (the tool connects in debug mode to the system and generates diagrams from runtime). Some visualizing techniques, using some tools to work not just with .java but also with e.g. JPA implementors like Hibernate.

The background says evaluation in huge letters, which is also annoying. The UML is decent, but definitely not standard. All in all, not what i'm looking for. On to something else...EDIT: Tried UMLet. Works well, very easy to get the hang of. Unfortunately it does not auto-pull any information from the source code. Will likely leave it installed for now",0

Convert from using 3 identical SQL params to 1,"I'm using the Java spring framework for security.  My pre-existing table layout differs from spring's expected, but I'm allowed to specify a custom authorities-by-username query on the jdbc-user-service.  The problem is that this query expects only a single parameter (?) in the SQL statement.  Basically, if the user exists in the users table at all, they should get 'ROLE_USER'.  If they exist in the auth table as 'S', they should get 'ROLE_USER', 'ROLE_LICENSEE' and 'ROLE_SYSADMIN'.  If they exist in the auth table as 'L', they should get both 'ROLE_LICENSEE', and 'ROLE_USER'.My question is how can I reduce this from 3 (?)'s down to 1?",1

Question about use of Controllers,"I was given a Use Case for a Quizz Application. The Use Case is only for creating new Quizzes. I am having trouble deciding which design is better:a)[alt text http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6187267/shooterpics/diagram1.jpg](""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6187267/shooterpics/diagram1.jpg"")b)[alt text http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6187267/shooterpics/diagram2.jpg](""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6187267/shooterpics/diagram2.jpg"")Although this might look like a Domain Model, it is in fact a Class Diagram (I was lazy to put the methods/attribtues in the diagrams :( ).The idea behind all this is that I have a QuizCatalog that has Quizzes. Each Quiz has a set of Questions, that must be created through a QuestionFactory(a Question is an abstract class, and QuestionA, QuestionB, etc are the concrete classes). Each Question has a set of PossibleAnswers.The difference in terms of associations between Design A and Design B is that in the first I am considereing that CreateQuizController will simply delegate every task it has to QuizCatalog. If QuizCatalog needs to do something, it will delegate everything it might need down the hierarchy. This is actually nice, as it seems to reduce coupling.Design B, on the other hand, follows a different philosophy. The associations seen in Design A still exist (as a QuizCatalog still has Quizzes, a Question PossibleAnswers, etc) but now I've made CreateQuizController have access basically to every kind of object in the domain it might need to create in the process(I've signaled those kind of associations with d). The idea is that instead of asking the QuizCatalog to create a Quiz, CreateQuizController will create a Quiz by itself (and if it needs to create Questions for the Quiz, it will by itself, the same happening for Question's PossibleAnwsers, etc). There are 2 things that bother me about Design A:1.If I need to create temporary objects that need to be filled up before being put ""in the system"" (for example, a Quiz is only actually added to QuizCatalog after it was filled with all the wanted Questions), following this design I'll have to keep them in some place other than the Controller. For example, when I first create a Quiz, I'll have to probably save it under QuizCatalog without actually adding it to the current collection of Quizzes that is accessible to the rest of the system. I find this kind of behaviour a bit awkward. I find it better to keep those kind of temporary objects in a Controller, as if anything wrong happens then the ""System"" is kept just as it was before, with no problems associated.The problem is that it makes the Controller have to know about almost everything, which might be undesirable. On the other hand, there is no difference in how coupled the rest of the classes in the System are.2.If I am going to use Design A, I actually don't see a big point in having a CreateQuizController, as basically everything can be done by just having a reference to QuizCatalog. In my eyes, it is just delegating all its work to QuizCatalog, so why have it in the first place?Also, using Design A, I'd probably consider QuestionFactory to be a Singleton, while if using Design B I'd probably just have CreateQuizController's constructor accept an instance of a QuestionFactory instead.What are your thoughts about this?ThanksPS: Only after drawing the diagrams I noticed that Quizz has 2 z's :( My bad.",0

I know that I need to be careful, because the shorthand words could match parts of other shorthand meanings.Hopefully this all makes sense.Thanks.Clarification:Dictionary is something like:lol:laugh out loud, rofl:rolling on the floor laughing, ll:like lemonsstring is:lol, i am roflreplaced text:laugh out loud, i am rolling on the floor laughingnotice how the ll wasnt added anywhere",1

Is there a visualization tool that can inspect a Java code base and report inter-package dependencies?,"We have a Java code base that has grown to be too big for a single monolithic JAR (more than 5000 classes).  One of the tasks that we are investigating is how much effort would it be to break this single JAR into smaller components with controlled dependencies between them.  However, it's somewhat hard to look at a big bag of code and be sure that you are finding the best points of separation without some analysis.Are there good tools to inspect and visualize the interpackage dependencies?  Given those, we would have a set of suggested cut points where we could begin separating code.As an example, in the days before Netbeans and Eclipse (and at a different job), we used TogetherJ and TogetherEnterprise.  Those had the ability to do a static package analysis and draw the UML diagram.  That sort of behavior would be optimal but that feature alone is not sufficient to justify the cost.",0
Determining synchronization scope?,"in trying to improve my understanding on concurrency issues, I am looking at the following scenario (Edit: I've changed the example from List to Runtime, which is closer to what I am trying):As it stands, each method is by thread safe when used standalone. Now, what I'm trying to figure out is how to handle where the calling class wishes to call:But as noted, there is no guarantee that the state will be consistent between the call to getAll() and the calls to remove(). If multiple threads call this, I'll be in trouble. So my question is - How should I enable the developer to perform the operation in a thread safe manner? Ideally I wish to enforce the thread safety in a way that makes it difficult for the developer to avoid/miss, but at the same time not complicated to achieve. I can think of three options so far:A: Make the lock 'this', so the synchronization object is accessible to calling code, which can then wrap the code blocks. Drawback: Hard to enforce at compile time:B: Place the combined code into the Example class - and benefit from being able to optimize the implementation, as in this case. Drawback: Pain to add extensions, and potential mixing unrelated logic: C: Provide a Closure class. Drawback: Excess code, potentially too generous of a synchronization block, could in fact make deadlocks easier:Is there something I'm missing? How should synchronization be scoped to ensure the code is thread safe?",0
Refactoring to move a private field from one class to its helper class?,"EDIT : I submitted an [Eclipse enhancement request for this refactoring](""https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=391281"").Is there a way to move a private field from one class to its helper class?  The below chicken-scratch UML shows what I'm doing manually right now.  Class C1 has private field and a private final reference to a Helper object before the refactoring.  After the refactoring, all references in C1' to field are changed to helper.getField() and helper.setfield() as appropriate.I've used Eclipse's refactoring capabilities quite a bit, but I can't figure out a way to automate this.For instance, ideally I would drag the private field/attribute/member from one class to another and hope that Eclipse asks me how I want to handle the unresolved references.  It offers no suggestions and breaks all of the references.The operation that I've been repeating is to separate knowledge and behavior that doesn't really belong in the current class.  I'm moving attributes and behavior that references certain fields out of the original class into a new ""helper"" class.  The first step in my refactoring is to move the fields.  A reference to the helper class exists as a field in the class I'm refactoring from.  In order not to break  C1 during the refactoring, I think it would be nice if Eclipse offered to to generate getters and setters in Helper' and update the references in C1 to use the getters/setters in the new class.",0

Best approach to integration test a Flex/Java web application via Maven?,"I am working on a project that is developing a webapp with a 100% Flex UI that talks via Blaze to a Java backend running on an application server.  The team has already created many unit tests, but have only created integration tests for the persistence module.  Now we are wondering the best way to integration test the other parts.  Here are the Maven modules we have now, I believe this is a very typical design:Server Side:1) a Java domain module -- this only has unit tests2) a Java persistence module (DAO) -- right now this only has integration tests that talk to a live database to test the DAOs, nothing really to unit test here3) a Java service module -- right now this only has unit tests Client Side:4) a Flex services module that is packaged as a SWC and talks to the Java backend -- currently this has no tests at all5) a Flex client module that implements the Flex UI on top of the Flex services module - this has only unit tests currently (we used MATE to create a loosely couple client with no logic in the views).These 5 modules are packaged up into a WAR that can be deployed in an application server or servlet container.Here are the 4 questions I have:Should we add integration tests to the service module or is this redundant given that the persist module has integration tests and the service module already has unit tests?  It also seems that integration testing the Flex-Services module is a higher priority and would exercise the services module at the same time.We like the idea of keeping the integration tests within their modules, but there is a circularity with the Flex services module and the WAR module.  Integration test for the Flex services module cannot run without an app-server and therefore those tests will haveto come AFTER the war is built, yes?What is a good technology tointegration test the Flexclient UIs (e.g. something likeSelenium, but for Flex)? Should we put final integration tests in theWAR module or create a separateintegration testing module that gets built after the WAR?Any help/opinions is greatly appreciated!",0

How to better organize classes/packages in a framework so that the client of my application can easily extend them?,"Let's assume I am in charge of developing a Scrabble game, being that one of the principal requirements of the client is the ability to later try out different ways and modes of the game. I already made a design that is flexible enough to support those kinds of changes. The only question left is what to expose to the client(objects' access modifiers), and how to organize it (how to expose my objects in namespaces/packages).How should I define things such that the client can both easily use my standard implementation (a standard Scrabble game, and yet be able to make all the modifications that he wants? I guess what I need is a kind of framework, on which he can work on.I organized my classes/interfaces in a non-strict layered system:Data TypesContains basic data types that might be used in the whole system. This package and its members can be accessed by anyone in the system. All its members are public.DomainContains all the interfaces I've defined and that might be useful to be able to make client's new Scrabble's implementations. Also contains value types, like Piece, that are used in the game. All its members are public.ImplementationsContains all the needed classes/code to implement my standard Scrabble game in a Implementations.StandardScrabble package. If the client decides to implement other variants of the game, he can create them in Implementations.XYZ, for example.These classes are all package protected and the only thing that is available to the outside of the package is a Game façade. Uses both Domain and Data Types packages.UIContains the UI class that I have implemented so that both the client and the users of the program can run the game (my implementation). Can access all the other layers.There are several drawbacks to the way I am organizing things, the most obvious being that if the client wants to create its own version of the game, he will have to basically implement almost everything by himself(I share in the Domain the interfaces, but he can do almost nothing with them). I feel I should maybe pass all the Implementation's classes to the Domain and then only have a Façade that builds up my standard Scrabble in the Implementations namespace?How would you approach this? Is there any recomended reading on how to build this kind of programs (basically, frameworks)?Thanks",0

Which kinds of associations do classes have in a system? How to best represent them in UML?,"This post is actually divided in two questions:Which kinds of associations classes/interfaces usually have?I'd say there are at least 3 kinds of dependencies:Inheritance : I think we all know this one)Dependency : with this I mean that if class A depends on class B, I can only instantiate class A if I pass it class B as constructor argument. Is this correct?Uses : class A uses class B if there is any kind of reference of class B in the code of class A that is neither inheritance of dependency.Are these the only kind of associations between classes? Are my interpretations of what they mean correct?Which kind of dependencies are of our interest to show on UML diagrams (mostly class/package diagrams)?Up until now, I've mostly only put in class diagrams arrows depicting dependencies associations. But now that I think of it, most of the time I look at class diagrams, I'll find something along the lines ofwhere only Inherits and Uses associations are shown. But those Uses in the class diagram aren't really the same kind of Uses I've defined above. They are just a way of telling you there's a getter on a class of a type that's not a primitive.I guess that if I had to look to some system's documentation I'd like to know how different classes in the system depend on each other. I'd definetely like to have some sort of Dependency Graph to look at. Would it better to restrict class diagrams to Inherits/Uses associations and then have other diagram/graph that shows Depends/Uses associations?How do you prefer it, and why?Thanks",0

Eclipse Content Assist Slowness with large projects,"I am facing extreme slowness in Java Content Assist with a large java project in Eclipse. The project has a lot of dependent jars (>100).

java threading memory management issues,"I'm working on a program right now that is essentially this: there is a 4 way stop with cars arriving on each road at random times.

I've gotten the thread synchronization and algorithm working no problem. The issue I can't quite figure out is how to prevent the error: OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread.

Do you confirm ?Moreover, I am really looking for a solution to this issue other that the one proposed on Eclipse forum consisting in activating my DragSource only if a given condition is met such as Shift is pressed (this is done in a DragSourceListener.dragStart method by setting event.doit to false)Any help, suggestions and comments are welcome.Thanks in advance,Manu",0

What's the proper design of a data reading/storing application?,"I need to read 200,000 or so records from a website and store them in DB. The application is a desktop app implemented on top of Netbeans Rich Client Platform. By using Apache HttpComponent library, I can send request to the website and retrieve the response that contains the record information; then using regex, I can fairly easily extract the dozen of fields that I need from the HTML.I am thinking to have 2 worker threads besides the GUI thread. One worker thread handles the HTTP request/response part and also extracts the record from the HTML using regex; while the other worker thread stores the records into DB. So, there will be a data structure to hold the records so that it can be shared between the two worker threads. I am also considering to have a buffer of size 100 (for example) for the HTTP worker thread to store the records, and when the buffer is full, transfer 100 records at one time to the shared records holder.Please comment on my design and also my questions are:what is the proper data structure to hold the records? how to synchronized it between the two worker threads?how would the multi-threads be implemented in the modular system of Netbeans Platform?",1

maven and unit testing - combining  maven surefire plugin AND testNG eclipse plugin,"could you please share your way of unit testing in eclipse ?

Then I started using Maven, but when I do ""maven test phase"" using m2eclipse, there is only console output and surefire reports that I can check in browser and to choose what test suite, test, or test method can be set up only via testng.xml.On the other hand, if you use only surefire plugin and you have some specific settings regarding classpath etc., that you rely on, then running tests via testNG eclipse plugin doesn't have to be compatible with your code. Using surefire plugin, the classpath is different - target/test-classes and target/classes - than using testNG plugin, that is using the project classpath.How do you go about what I was just talking about?Is it possible to synchronize ""maven test"" using m2eclipse and surefire plugin WITH testNG eclipse plugin and view ?EDITED: I'm also wondering, why the Maven project (""Java build path"") output folder is target/classes for src/main and src/test whereas surefire plugin makes two locations target/test-classes and target/classesThank you very much for your your opinions.",0

Releasing with Maven,"I recently released a maven project and could not stop thinking that the whole process is very complicated and error prone. Let us say I have an application which consists of 3 modules A, B and C, each having its own folder in subversion and a separate build job in Hudson. Each module has a parent POM which aggregates multiple artifacts. A depends on B, and B depends on C. The dependency versions are defined in a top level POM D, which is the parent of A, B and C. It does nothing else than making sure all versions are kept in one place and that there is only one version of each artifact used in the whole project. In order to make the release I do the following:Release the top level POM D with the release plugin through Hudson.Start at C which has no further dependencies.Change C to reference the released version of D. Release C with the release plugin.Enter the released version of C in D, so modules that depend on C can be released with the stable version of C.Release D again with the release plugin.Do 3-5 for BDo 3-5 for AAfter that I have stable non-snapshot builds of all artifacts in A, B and C and can assemble them together to a final stable release of the application.In real, I had not only 3 but like 20 such modules. Now I find this procedure very complicated and I think it has a lot of potential problems:I need to release D several times, once for each level in the dependency hierarchy. In the end I have D with only stable versions of A, B and C in it. To go on with the next development version I have to edit D again and reference all the new snapshot versions of the released modules. In general, the dependency management has to be done all by hand, even when using the release plugin.If somebody commits while I am doing the release it could mess up things. To be sure I would have to checkout a specific revision over all modules, build and test it, and then do the release for all modules on that revision. But how do I ensure that with Hudson and multiple jobs?Dependent on 3 different systems: Subversion server, Hudson server and the Maven archive server. If only one is down I can not release anymore.Time consuming. In this process a lot of building, packaging, uploading, downloading, extracting, etc. is made again and again for each module I release. A lot of redundant data exchange with the archive happens. But actually everything could be done locally, since Hudson has all the source code it needs. Just once in the end the final package needs to be uploaded.Say I loose the packages on the archive server. There is no easy way to tell Hudson to check out the tagged versions and rebuild them all in the proper order.Why can this not be as easy as checkout all the code in one shot, adapt one global version, build and test it, commit, tag the commit and finally upload the binaries?Thanks for any ideas on this.",0

Synchronisation problem on a variation of the classic bounded buffer problem using java,"I made a variation on the classic bounded buffer problem.It's a LOT different and there is a small technical bump in the road I need to know for threadsafety ( rather than testing endlessly for a sitatuation that MAY never occur)I don't really think I need to explain the situation it's about the evaluation of the following code sampleBasically my buffer1 has a simple condition variable (updated and all) that lets me know if it's not full and then I aquire a lock , do the magic, and release the lock.But can I simply assume that evaluating the condition ""is buffernotfull"" can not interleave with another thread just writing over the LAST slot in my buffer?(The buffer is actually an array of values with -1 representing empty, don't ask why ^_^)In short: Is the evaluation of threadsafe with the body code aquiring the lockEDITThis is the system I am now using for my entire system.

rotate a picture around it's center,"Is there an easy way to rotate a picture around it's center? I used an [AffineTransformOp](""http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/awt/image/AffineTransformOp.html"") first. It seems simple and need and finding the right parameters for a matrix should be done in a nice and neat google session. So I thought...My Result is this:Really simple if you ignore the cases of rotating multiples of 90 degrees (which can't be handled correctly by sin() and cos()). The problem with that solution is, that it transforms around the (0,0) coordinate point in the upper left corner of the picture and not around the center of the picture what would be normally expected. So I added some stuff to my filter:My thinking here was that the form changing matrix should be the unity matrix (is that the right english word?) and the vector that moves the whole picture around are the last 2 entries. My solution first makes the picture bigger and then smaller again (doesn't really matter that much - reason unknown!!!) and also cuts around 3/4 of the picture away (what matters a lot - reason is probably that the picture is moved outside of the reasonable horizon of the ""from (0,0) to (width,height)"" picture dimensioning).Through all the mathematics I am not so trained in and all the errors the computer does while calculating and everything else that doesn't get into my head so easily, I don't know how to go further.

Eclipse: OSGI Preferences vs. PreferenceStore,"I'm working on an Eclipse plugin (or in fact, a plugin for an Eclipse-based application) which needs some configuration to be entered by the user.From looking at the documentation, there seem to be two preference APIs - one in [org.eclipse.core.runtime.preferences](""http://help.eclipse.org/helios/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/core/runtime/preferences/package-summary.html""), extending/implementing the [OSGI prefererence API](""http://www.osgi.org/javadoc/r4v42/index.html?org/osgi/service/prefs/package-summary.html""), another one, JFace specific, in [org.eclipse.jface.preference](""http://help.eclipse.org/helios/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/jface/preference/package-summary.html""). Then we have [org.eclipse.ui.preferences](""http://help.eclipse.org/helios/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/preferences/package-summary.html""), too.The OSGI API has a hierarchic Node tree - a preference node (Preferences or IEclipsePreferences) can have multiple subnodes, which themselves can contain both individual name-value-pairs as well as more subnodes. This seems to be right for my use case - I have a dynamic number of ""preference groups"", each with about three string properties (name, description, command), which would nicely map to these nodes.The JFace API has no such hierarchy, only a flat IPreferenceStore for each plugin. But it provides preference editor pages, which then can be included in the usual preferences dialog (Window / Preferences) by implementing IWorkbenchPreferencePage and [using the ""org.eclipse.ui.preferencePages"" extension point](""http://help.eclipse.org/helios/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/guide/preferences_prefs_contribute.htm"").  (I still have to implement part of the preference page myself, but this API provides a good base for this, it seems.)It seems that the [org.eclipse.ui.preferences](""http://help.eclipse.org/helios/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/api/org/eclipse/ui/preferences/package-summary.html"") API somehow bridges both these APIs by providing an IPreferenceStore implementation based on the IEclipsePreferences, but I still can't see how to use this.So here my question: How can I use the hierarchical OSGI Preferences in the preferences-dialog? I only need one level, but I need the user to be able to dynamically add new nodes (with about three preferences each). (These nodes do not have to have new preference-pages, though.)",0

Netbeans Project Types,"I'm building a Java application using NetBeans 7.0.

Best practices for entitlement using spring security and/or shiro,"I'm interested in opinions on the best way to handle the concept of ""entitlement"" using either Spring Security or Shiro.For example, imagine, say, a JAX-RS endpoint that has a signature like this:Using Spring Security, I might annotate an implementation like:or using Shiro,What I am looking for, however, is some recommendations on ""best practices"" for how to ensure that the user has permission to access the particular account id (which I think is called ""entitlement management"").I could imagine a couple of different approaches:(which strikes me as not completely straightforward using Spring Security, but I'd love to be wrong).Or, I could imagine introducing an AccountId domain object, and a factory which will only succeed in turning a String into an AccountId if the principle held by the current security context allows that users to see that account. But that starts to get a bit messy.On the whole, I don't want to invent new concepts here; this seems like bread &amp; butter stuff, but I've not had much luck finding credible recommendations around best practices here.Thanks for any suggestions.",0

How to prevent Circular References with Dependency Injection and Garbage Collection?,"I think I'm still trying to understand Dependency Injection and the role of the DI container.If DI means a lower level component depends on a higher level one, and there's no circular reference, won't that object get garbage collected? As I see garbage collection (mark-and-sweep), it keeps only the objects that can be traced with a chain of references starting from the program root.Since I'm having difficulty explaining myself, here are two UML diagrams, which present conflicting views of Dependency Injection, as I see it:  My original interpretation of DIThe DI Container injects components with their required references, and they each store a reference to their next-highest-in-command. The Main class has no way of reaching them, so they should be garbage collected.My reconsideration of DIThe DI Container injects components with their required references and also maintains a reference to each of them. They each store a reference to their next-highest-in-command. The Main class can reach any of them via the DI Container, so they shouldn't be garbage collected.",1

The data is being stored in a sqlite DB, and I am using a SimpleCursorAdapter to populate the data for holes that have already been scored. here is that code:From searching the internet I've found what I think are two posibilities that SHOULD work, but do not.First I've tried the XML Attribute: android.visibility. It looks like this in the PORTION of the view that I am trying to ""test"" hide:I have tried it with ""GONE"", ""Gone"" and ""gone"". NONE of them work in the eclipse emulator OR on my actual phone. So, there is no point in trying to parameterize this attribute.Next I've tried setting the XML attribute for android:layout_height to ""0dip"". This indeed works in the emulator and on my phone WHEN IT IS HARDCODED.Then I moved to the next logical step (as I see it), storing a parameter in the DB so that I can ""show"" or ""not show"" the item DEPENDING on conditions within the record. So, I've stored a field in the DB with two values ""0dip"" and ""wrap_content"". I pass these to the layout as shown in the java above as R.id.skip. I've also added these to the output just to audit that they are really there. Here is that XML:In the above test, both via the Eclipse emulator and my android phone, the last TextView confirms that the DB contains either ""0dip"" or ""wrap_content"", BUT the LinearLayout with:behaves as if it were ""0dip"" ALL of the TIME. In other words, I cannot PROGRAMMATICALLY"" affect the XML attribute for android:layout_height.If there is a better/more standard way of accomplishing what I am trying to do, please share - BUT BE CLEAR. I am new, so CODE EXAMPLES wwill work best for me.May 29th - It seems to me (based on testing) that you cannot alter layout attributes for the layout specified in this code:Anything I try leads to some error ort another.

The problem is that the code is poorly documented, what little documentation is incomplete, sometimes wrong and the original devs are unavailable.It uses a custom Perl build script requires a thousand modules from CPAN to work and I do not know Perl.  Reverse engineering into UML has failed except with Doxygen and that is limited to just inheritance diagrams and call graphs.I've obtained a massive chalkboard and I'm slowly trawling through the code, modeling packages and then the nested packages within.My question is whether or not I'm approaching this reverse engineering from the right direction. I'm working close from the bottom trying to figure out what calls what while developing UML and writing a Design Document. I did a package diagram but it's hard to figure out what's going on at that high a level.An academic paper I pulled up suggests I also make a new Requirements Document which would slow me down even more and I don't know if it's a good idea as the other developers are always busy trying to keep the legacy system up.Are there any books out there that can help me and am I approaching this from the right angle? Should I hire a contract worker that knows Perl and JMX to assist me?",0
UML for multithreading dataflow,"I want to paint a diagram where you can see the dataflow of a java program, and if there are one or multiple threads handling the data.Sequence charts don't show multithreading and get very confusion when you have more than 5 different entities.Class diagrams are good for showing the relations but the dataflow is missing.I would like to paint boxes (like class/package diagram) and connect them.

Split the touch screen into 4 quadrants?,I'm creating a simple game on android where you touch a certain part of the screen when told to do so.

Auto import new Java classes added to project path on startup in Eclipse,"For simplicists: You can only read the bold part.I'm using Dropbox (for those of you who don't know what Dropbox is: it is a service that creates a universal folder that is stored online but can be accessed on any computer and changes are reflected to all.) to store my Java Eclipse Project. So, when I add a new Java Class to the Dropbox from home, it shows in the Dropbox folder in the office computer. However, I have to import it to Eclipse to view it. Is there a way that the files I add from home can be imported to Eclipse automatically? Maybe Eclipse has a setting that searches all the Java files in the Project directory on every startup and auto imports them?

Can an array contain integers and floats,"Somebody asked me: can an array in java contain integers and floats? She got that question from a teacher. Now my answer was: yes, since you can declare an array of objects and store integers and floats in it.But now I'm wondering if that is correct, since technically when you store Integer and Float objects in an array, it kind of does contain both types, but if you would ""ask"" the array he would tell you he contains Objects, and if I don't do bookkeeping or class checks there's no way to tell that there are integers and floats in the array.On the other hand I still feel it might be the right answer since theoretically the array contains objects of both types.So I'm asking for a smart opinion: if you were asked (in an interview, a test whatever) wether in java an array can contain integers and floats, yes or no? What would you answer?",0

How to configure gradle to use a local repository only for certain dependency groups?,"Working off the [gradle dependency docs](""http://www.gradle.org/dependency_management.html""), we have a build.gradle with snippets like this.This setup does download everything correctly, but I would like to tweak it so that things in group localRepo are only attempted to be pulled from the ivy repository and localRepo is only used for group localRepo.  localRepo only holds private jars so we do not want it to be used as the first repo and we do not want to spend a long time querying mavenCentral for jars that will not exist.Basically I would like to say in the dependency to use a specific repo or that the local ivy repo is only to be used for specific groups.

How to run two webprojects in Spring ToolSuite without conflicts?,"I have two Spring-based web projects open in Spring ToolSuite that I need to be able to work on and debug in at the same time. However, I am running into difficulties.Project A is a standard MVC website project, Project B is a webservices host that performs a lot of backend functions for Project A (and others).Project B distributes a number of Model and Service classes that Project A consumes through Maven as artifact jars.Project A runs on one instance of tomcat (actually STS TC Server) on port 8080.Project B runs on a second instance of tomcat (standalone tc6) on port 8083.If I have Project B closed in STS, both projects run fine and everything works. However, if I have Project B open and try and start the tomcat instance that Project A runs on, I receive all sorts of exceptions concerning missing classes that would be found in the Maven artifact.I need to be able to run and debug both projects at the same time ideally as we develop new services and clients but this is proving impossible due to the above problems.We have tried making the Project B a required project of A, changing build-path properties to try and force those classes onto the buildpath for A and so on, but nothing has worked so far.Does anyone have any experience of this sort of problem and a potential solution? One of the guys on the team has used two instances of Eclipse to work around the problem, but running two instances of Eclipse is slow and clunky and has it's own issues tbh so I would rather avoid this if possible and stick to one IDE instance for debugging.Any suggestions gratefully received.",0

How can I display map data (prefererably using OpenStreetMaps) in my java application?,"I currently have an Android app that downloads map data from tile.openstreetmap.org.

How to redefine an attribute in inherited classes in JPA,"I have a generic Database structure which can store several user-defined records.

However, this structure exists and can't be changed. Now I want to create some JPA classes.First, I created an abstract class RECORD as follows (the Annotations are placed on the gettersthe example is just simplified):Then, I created specific classes inherited from RECORD:This works fine, as I can query RECORD for a PERSON's primary key (via EntityManager.find()) and get a Result as instance of PERSON.

Unicode-correct title case in Java,"I've been looking through all StackOverflow in the bazillion of questions about capitalizing a word in Java, and none of them seem to care the least about internationalization and as a matter of fact none really seem to work in an international context. So here is my question.I have a String in Java, which represents a word - all isLetter() characters, no whitespace. I want to make the first character upper case and the rest lower case. I do have the locale of my word in handy.It's easy enough to call .substring(1).toLowerCase(Locale) for the last part of my string.I have no idea how to get the correct first character, though.The first problem I have is with Dutch, where ""ij"" being a digraph should be capitalized together. I could special-case this by hand, because I know about it; now there may be other languages with this kind of thing that I don't know about, and I'm sure Unicode will tell me if I ask nicely. But I don't know how to ask.Even if the above problem is solved, I'm still stuck with no proper way to handle English, Turkish and Greek, because Character supports titlecase but no locale, and String supports locales but not titlecase.If I take the code point, and pass it to Character.toTitleCase(), this will fail because there is no way to pass the locale to this method. So if the system locale is in English but the word is Turkish, and the first char of the word is ""i"", I'll get ""I"" instead of ""İ"" and this is wrong.Now if I take a substring and use .toUpperCase(Locale), this will fail because it's upper and not title case. So if the word is Greek, I'll still get the wrong character.If anyone has useful pointers, I'd be happy to hear them.",1

How do I include a dependency's test jar into a Maven project's deployment?,"I have two projects, foo and foo-web under the com.example group. foo-web depends on foo.To be able to develop the UI part of the application without depending on external services,  dummy DAOs were implemented in foo (they return static data so we don't have to connect to databases etc). We were required to move the dummy classes to src/test/java. This means that they don't get deployed with foo.jar to the war built from the web project. I found [these instructions](""http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-attached-tests.html"") on the maven site, but they don't seem to work for me.In foo's pom.xml I have:When running mvn install on foo-web, in the target of foo I'd get two jars: foo-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar and foo-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-tests.jar. They both get installed fine in the local maven repository.Before, the foo-web dependency looked like this:And that would trigger the deployment of foo-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar in the war. Now, I want to also deploy the -tests jar, preferably only for a ""local"" profile.I tried in various ways to do this:This causes the source jar to be deployed with a different name: com.example-foo.jar and does not deploy the test jar. I also tried using  instead of  in the dependency, but it still does the same. I tried using the above dependency outside of the profile (alongside the others), but it still behaves the same.If I add the  to the main dependency (without adding the other dependency) I get the test jar deployed (with the same name as above), but the source, naturally, does not get deployed.The only difference from what's written in the documentation is the fact that the scope is not specified for the test dependency. Does it only work for the test scope? Can I somehow deploy the test classes differently.I know the question's a bit convoluted, please let me know if there's something I can clarify.Thanks!Update:I tried it in several more ways but it still won't work.I added another execution to the maven-jar-plugin in the foo project (the dependency, not the main web project) in which I hoped to force maven to compile the test classes in the same jar as the main ones and reference the big bundle by a different classifier. I couldn't get it to work:The jar was generated with the batman classifier, but I couldn't find any way to get it to include test classes in the jar goal.Doing this, I realized that this does not depend on the test-jar type/tests classifier/test scope relationship. When I tried to specify the new jar I'm building besides the main one, I got the same behavior as when trying to include the -tests jar. I checked the local maven repository and both all jars from the dependent project are getting installed fine, so the problem is the main project's dependency resolution.tl;drEverything boils down to the question if you can include the same dependency with multiple classifiers. From what I saw until now, the answer is no - I always get the com.example-foo jar when specifying the same dependency multiple times with different classifiers.",0

continued encryption with diffie-hellman shared key,"I'm currently working on a protocol, which uses Diffie-Hellman for an key exchange.I receive a packet, which consists of an aes-128 encrypted part and a 128 Bit DH Public Key.In a very last step in the protocol, the aes key is sent to another peer in the network.This aes-key should be encrypted with a cipher using a 128 bit strong secretkey.I plan to use Blowfish (can also be another cipher, doesn't really matter for the problem)Now to encrypt the aes-key, with lets say blowfish, I have to build a secretkey for the encryption  with a class called SecretKeySpec (I'm using javax.crypto stuff), which takes an byteArray in the constructor to build the secretKey.The sharedkey from DH is a 128 Bit BigInteger.Well, now I can interpret my shared-key as a byteArray (wich gives me still 128 Bit in 16Bytes [where the numbers are interpreted as frames of 8 Bit data])So my question is, how strong is my key really?Is there any impact because I only use numbers as input for the byteArray (so does this limit the keyspace in any way?)I think this is not the case, but I'm not 100% sure.Maybe someone can do the math and proof me right or wrong.If I'm wrong what keysize for the shared key give me piece of mind to finally get to the 128Bit SecretKey for the encryption?",0
How to find out what AsyncTask was running?,"In one of my Activities I do have up to six different AsyncTasks that may run on different events. All AsyncTasks handle orientation changes gracefully (at least I hope so). In onRetainNonConfigurationInstance() I do return the AsyncTask object of a currently running AsyncTask. Later, during onCreate(), I need to find out what AsyncTask object is returned from getLastNonConfigurationInstance().I use the Activity context in all onPostExecute() methods to get the new activity (if there is a new one). I found this concept here on StackOverflow and did modify it a little bit because I don't like that ""Trash running tasks on orientation change"" paradigma. Hope this concept is correct.In the code shown below you'll find two different AsyncTasks. During onRetainNonConfigurationInstance() I will return the currently running AsyncTask. My problem is within onCreate(). How to find out what object is returned? What AsyncTask was running when orientation change bumped in?Both AsyncTasks are different in many areas (not shown here) so I didn't use an own extended AsyncTask base object.Many thanks in advance.",1

Java properties files localization & character encoding issue,"I am working on a Java web application which is now in the final stages of development and one of the remaining things to be done is the localization.

The web pages have UTF-8 encoding specified in the charset meta tag and the browser has correctly detected it (In Firefox View->Character Encoding the correct one seems to be selected). I believe the issue comes from the fact that while the application displays text as UTF-8, the properties files are saved in ISO*xxxx encoding, which happens to be some eclipse default setting.I have found a similar question here: Java properties UTF-8 encoding in Eclipse which advices me to install the Resource Bundle Plug-in. I installed and used the plug-in to edit the corresponding properties, but I still have the issue.Is there a quick solution (I mean a solution that will not cause too much changes in the application, since it is in almost finished stage) that will overcome the problem I am experiencing. Maybe I should mention that I am developing and observing the problem under Ubuntu Linux OS using Firefox 7. Thanks in advance.Edit:I did not mention an important matter. My user interface is written in GWT and the properties are exposed by an interface which has annotations on the getters that GWT uses to internally create an implementation of that interface and link to the corresponding property.

JAX-RS in relation to Jersey and JSRs,"I'm trying to get my head around some concepts in Java:JSR(s): describe specifications, but carry no actual implementations. E.g.

To find it you'll have to google ""JSR XXX reference implementation"" or see the specifications home page (e.g. [http://jsr311.java.net/](""http://jsr311.java.net/""))For JSR-311 this reference implementation is [Jersey](""http://jersey.java.net/""). Using maven you can get the jersey server from [http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.sun.jersey/jersey-server/1.9](""http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.sun.jersey/jersey-server/1.9""). Since Jersey provides an implementation according to the interfaces found in [http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax.ws.rs/jsr311-api](""http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax.ws.rs/jsr311-api""), you only need to add Jersey as a dependency in your project and not the jsr311-api itself.

How can I format my array elements?,"This is what I have so far:  This code will create an array of six integers and populated by random numbers (1 - 49) using the for loop then sorts the elements into ascending order.What I would like to do after that is have a method print the array elements in the following format:Normally this could be done using:And so on...However, since there is the possibility of some of the numbers having only one digit, how would one go about ensuring the proper format by leaving a black space?So that it would look like this (example numbers):Notice the extra space in front of the single digit elements. I've thought of something like:that could then be used in something like:But I can't think of a way to make that work since an array of integers can only contain integer values so I'm probably not on the right lines with that method.

"PreparedStatement , CallableStatement and Performance Considerations","I have a oracle stored proc that needs to be called from my Java program. I had used CallableStatement to pass parameters to the stored proc. I am using oracle thin driver (configured in web logic server against the relevant jndi entry).This stored proc does not have any OUT values. This stored proc accepts a numeric value and does a lot of updates in the db based on the value received. I get a connection object and then call this stored proc in loop (20 times for passing 20 numbers). When I directly call this stored proc from an oracle client , the execution gets completed in 2-3 seconds. However the behaviour is not predictable from my java code. Some of the calls take even 30-40 seconds to get completed. I tried to use PreparedStatement instead of CallableStatement and could see marginal performance improvement (though the behaviour is still inconsistent).Is it OK in my case to use PreparedStatement instead of CallableStatement given that the storedproc does not have any OUT parameters?Is there any reason why PreparedStatement has some performance gain over CallableStatement or is it something that I might have observed incorrectly?Is there a better approach for solving this performance issue?",1

Default detail formatter for arrays in Eclipse,"When debugging a java program in Eclipse, in the Variables view, when you highlight a variable it prints detail for that variable in the pane below.  That pane is called the ""Detail View,"" and the value displayed is the ""detail"" for the variable.  By default, it is simply the result of calling .toString() on the variable.  But Eclipse allows you to specify and customize ""Detail Formatters"" for arbitrary objects that maps them to more helpful and descriptive strings in that view.My question is this: the .toString() method invoked on an array (say of Integers) returns an unhelpful memory address.  However, when I highlight an array variable in debug mode, Eclipse seems to intelligently parse it into a really helpful comma-delimited string (e.g. ""[42, 13, null, 19]"").  I gather that means Eclipse has established a default Detail Formatter for arrays with really helpful functionality.  Does anyone know how I can leverage that Detail Formatter in my code to avoid rewriting identical logic?In case you're interested, the motivation is generating the contents of an IN clause for a SQL query.  That is, I'm trying to generate a SQL Query:from on an arbitrary int[]:I realize I could accomplish this by writing a for loop, using StringBuilder, etc., but I was wondering if Eclipse has already done that for me and exposes a helpful method (Read: I am exceedingly lazy)",0

Fast loading of elements into array/list with fixed index without duplicates,"My requirement is to enter strings into an array which are not in the array. I also need to maintain fixed indexes, as this array will be used with other data structure with a one-to-one relation with each index. At present i am using the ArrayList class and checking with the indexOf () method to check if it exists first, if not then add it into the list with the add () method with one argument. I am not familiar to the classes in java, and therefore could not understand how can i implement it with HashMap or something else (trie or else), which will  make the loading process fast .Do the indexOf () in ArrayList makes a sequential search ?My point is to reduce the processing time when loading the words into the array, with not inserting duplicates, and maintain fixed index of the elements. If a word tested is already in the array, then the index in which it is already inserted is required, as this index is needed to index into some other structure and do some processing. Any suggestions to make this process better?UPDATEThere is an array, i have some documents from where i need to scan each word and find unique words in the documents. But also i need to count the number of duplicates. Stated in other way, i need to count the term frequencies of the unique terms occurring in the documents. I am maintaining a ArrayList of term frequency (number of terms x number of docs). I am fetching one word and then checking if it is in the word list with the indexOf () method. If it is not present in the word list, then i am inserting the word into the list, and allocating a new row in the 2d array (the Array) and then setting the count of the term element in 2d array to 1. If the word is already in the word array, then i use the index of the word in the array to index in the row of the Array matrix, and use the current under processing document number to get to the cell and increment the count.My question is to reduce the indexOf () processing time for each word i am currently using. I need to get the index of the word in the word array if it is already in there, and if it is not in there then i need to insert it into the array dynamically.Sample CodeNote: code is snipped to keep the focus on the question",1

"java, static methods issue in a real case. TableModel implementation","I want to implement a TableModel, that will enable my existing data structure to be displayed by a JTable. Say my data structure is a simple List, where MyRow is:My idea is that this class ""should do its part"" in being displayed, so i add it the following method, that simply maps each field to an index: At this point, the TableModel implementation will simply be:Neat, isn't it? :-)  Ok, but return 2; annoys me. In this ""architecture"" i have assigned to MyRow the rexposibility to represent a row, and so it should be MyRow that gives the number of columns. That because it provides the getValueAt(int columnIndex) method that is related to the number of columns: columnsIndexThis piece of information may be asked even if there are no rows in the List, so no instances of MyRow. So the method to add to MyRow should be a static method: And the getColumnCount() method of MyModel will be simply modified accordingly:Now MyRow contains all the data needed to represent a row. It is easy to show that: adding, removing or changing columns is just question of modifying MyRow.Clean, isn't it? :-) :-) The problem is that with static methods, i can't provide an abstract super-class for MyRow.This should be obvious, but to be sure:then then i implement a ""generic"" MyData, that uses a MyAbstractRow:This is resolved on the static type (so returns 0) because the getColumnCount of MyData  doesn't even have a reference to the type i actually want to use as my concrete implementation of MyAbstractRow.

The structure of his project is such that:The src and bin directories are in a directory called Circle, which itself is listed under my home directory.Eclipse is installed under my home directory as well, but in a different folder called eclipse.So, my friend's src directory has two subdirectories, circle and racket. racket is another guy's project, but I imagine that both these directories will need to be used early on in my projectUnder the circle subdirectory are even more subdirectories, called characters, experiments, and core. Each of them only contain java files related to the project, but circle.java (the name of the project) is listed under the ""core"" subdirectory. However, ""experiment.java"" is listed under the ""experiments"" subdirectory, which I am not sure why it does not contain the main() method of the project.... (you want to run the experiment, right?) Instead, the main() method of the project is contained inside circle.java, which I am not sure why....Anyway, I was hoping someone could help me set this small project up (properly) using Eclipse. I've never used Eclipse before, so some intuitive steps may need to be explained. Thank you so much, in advance for helping :)****EDIT: Also, where should I put the workspace? Should it be defined in the home directory, or inside my friend's top Circle directory?",0

Interacting with JTable which is rapidly updated with new rows,"Brief description of a problem.Assume we have JTable and user interacting with it in some way. TableModel of this table is constantly changing. How to ensure that when user tries to get some info from the table by referencing some constant column and currently selected row (by its rowIndex he got from JTable), he will not get into situation when TableModel is changed and his rowIndex obtained from JTable is no longer corresponding to same value in TableModel.Following is initial question which explains problem in more detail:Consider following situation:There is JTable which shows user info about currently running requests in some systemWhen new request enters system, new row is being added to the tableuser can interact with table by right-clicking on a row (single row selection model is used in table) and choosing option from the menu (like: abort, postpone, retry, etc.)there is separate class which implements ActionListener interface (listens to the table) and handles all user interactionsWhen user does some action on the table this class checks currently selected row and assigns some values for user's action (basically it takes index of selected row and then calls tableModel.getValueAt(indexOfSelectedRow, someValuableDataColumnIndex))Now consider scenario when system is under stress test and requests are being submitted constantly with big frequency. This, in my case, leads to a bug, when sometimes class which handles user's actions gets wrong info from table model (action was called on one row, but action is done for another, usually next one). I believe this happens because during some inits in action handling class table model is changed because of new request accepted.Question is, how to fix this. I am thinking about two approaches:use something like invokeAndWait() for initialization in my user actions' handling class (don't like this idea, because imo it will lead to other unpredictable bugs)creating separate listener class which will listen to user selections in the table and store data from selected row as soon as it was selected separately from TableModel. This way actions handling class will take data not from table model which is being changed, but from selected row, which is constant during the described scenario. (not sure this idea will work)Please, comment on my ideas, and suggest yours.I am sorry for absence of any code here, but original code will take way too much space, and model example isn't something what can be done easily here.",1

Maven - Building a single java/servlet based war file from multiple modules,"I posted a question last week on how i can build dependent modules and the result was that it was recommended that i use a build tool like Maven or Ivy.

Here is an example structure of the modulesModule 1Module2Module3 As you can probably see, the above will all collectively form one application. What i would like to do is to end up with an artifact for each module. Because of the mixture of file types(jsp,css,java) i am not quite sure what is a suitable artifact. The diagram below show the structure of the war file i would like to end up with. A couple of notes    - The java files in commonModule are built and end up in WEB-INF/classes    - The java files for the customerModule end up as a jar file in WEB-INF/lib    - The java files for the productModule end up as a jar file in WEB-INF/lib    - All of the jsps,css end up in the root of the war file What is the best way i should store the artifact for each module in the repository?I could use a jar file but this cant hold the html type files(jsp,css,js etc)Each module (except the commonModule) will contain a jar file + the jsp, css files. I am thinking of storing the built artifact as a zip file and extract it when the MyApp.war is built to build the war file?Can i store the artifact for each module as a war file even though only one has a web.xml file?How can i implement this using MavenI have been investigating Maven and found that it might be possible to have a multi module project with the following structureMyApp.pom (parent project)    commonModule.pom    customer.pom    product.pomIf i zipped up the modules in the repository how would i refer to them from the parent project and unzip them to build the final war file?Is it possible to automatically trigger the build of the parent project if any of the child projects are built? I havent figured out how to maintain the version of each of the child projects. If i build the customer project, how does the parent project know that there is a newer version of the customer.zip (or .jar) in the repository?Assuming the repository currently contains the following|-productModule.v.0.1.zip|-customerModule.v.0.1.zip|-commonModule.v.0.1.zipIf i rebuild, the customerModule and then rebuild the war file buy building the parent project, does maven rebuild all of the other modules in the repository even if they have not changed?

Assume the modules have the following structure:Module 1Module2Module3Each of the modules shown will be developed by a different team. Each team produces a war file and installs it in the local maven repository. As an example the repository could look like thisNow the build manager uses the above war files to build the final deployable war file.

I did test the merging of war files with overlays and found that the following configuration worked. i.e. using dependencies:Note: These dependencies are in the commonModule pom fileIf i then build the commonModule module, i end up with one war file that contains all the contents of Module1, Module2 and Module3. Which ends up with something like this:The above works but requires a bit of manual intervention for a full release. Here is an example of what would happen if a module is modifiedTeam 1 updating module 1The above does not use a multi module project as you suggested so i am trying to understand how the versioning would work with multi module projects. For example, lets say the multi module project will look like thisWhat is the difference in adding the version number in each child module compared to just havin the version number on the parent?You say that the child modules will use the parent version. Lets say the parent version is currently version 3.4, how will it know that it is supposed to use version 3.1 of the productModule.war?And finally, if team 1 has made a change to one of the child modules, would they still need to build it and deploy it on to the maven repository as an individual product first before building the multi-module project or can this be done as one step?How would this work if i want to make a patch release that does not necessarily mean using the latest version of a specific module?Thanks",0

Java indexOf function more efficient than Rabin-Karp? Search Efficiency of Text,"I posed a question to Stackoverflow a few weeks ago about a creating an efficient algorithm to search for a pattern in a large chunk of text.     Right now I am using the String function indexOf to do the search.   One suggestion was to use Rabin-Karp as an alternative.    I wrote a little test program as follows to test an implementation of Rabin-Karp as follows.And here is the implementation of Rabin-Karp that I am using:The implementation of Rabin-Karp works in that it returns the correct offset of the string I am looking for.    What is surprising to me though is the timing statistics that occurred when I ran the test program.   Here they are:This was really surprising.   Not only is Rabin-Karp (at least as it is implemented here) not faster than the standard java indexOf String function, it is slower by an order of magnitude.    I don't know what is wrong (if anything).    Any one have thoughts on this?Thanks,Elliott",1
Managing Libraries in Eclipse,"When you clone an eclipse project from a repository, project's build path contains errors because of missing libraries. So each member of the team has to search and put the library jars to same location so that , when we clone a project, we don't have any problem.

One of the approach is to put all jars into some network share \\xxx\libraries, and add the jars from this network share. But is it the best idea ? ",0

IllegalValue when reading .uml file with eclipse MDT UML2,"I have created a simple state machine model in Enterprise Architect and exported it to a file, which I want to read into a standalone Java/Scala program based on Eclipse's MDT UML2 implementation.I managed to get this partially working, but still have two remaining problems:The exported XMI file from EA contains more than just the  part, in which case I only get AnyTypeImpl objects after parsing.

Installing OSGi dependencies with maven-bundle-plugin,"I have a java project that compiles down to an OSGi bundle.  I'm using the maven-bundle-plugin to create the bundle, and the maven-sling-plugin to push the bundle to my running OSGi server.  At the moment, my project has two dependencies (Guava and Gson) that need to be manually installed in the Felix server prior to installing the bundle.  The manual install for these two dependency bundles only needs to occur once (when first setting up the OSGi server), but since it's a manual process, I'd kind of like to just push it into the ""mvn install"" phase.I've looked at a number of maven plugins (maven-sling-plugin, maven-ipojo-plugin, dependency plugins, etc.), but I'm afraid that I just don't have enough knowledge to know where to start, or even to search in Stackoverflow for the solution (I have a suspicion that this has already been answered). So - is there a clean way to install/start dependent bundles with maven?

"What if in bridge pattern, Abstraction has an AutoClosable implementer","For people who are familiar with bridge pattern, we know it uses composition to include the concrete implementer as part of the refined abstraction. so basically we are expected to use the Abstraction as a client of this pattern.     /--Implementer--/    Interface Implementer extends AutoClosable {        public void open();        public void close();    }As the code above shown, I've hit an issue where my implementer happens to be an AutoClosable. In my case, I will directly use Abstraction at the client side and use a string as the constructor parameter to determine what concrete implementer I will use. But this kinda leaves me in a situation where I can't use try-with-resources(Abstraction ab =  new RefinedAbstraction(""implementorA"")), because Complier would complain that my abstraction is not a AutoCloseable. It doesn't make sense to put concreteImplementor instance in the try-with-resouces block, because it's the methods in Abstraction Interface actually wanted here.The only way to get around this I can think of is that, I can use try/catch with finally block to explicitly close out my Abstraction.implementer instead of trying to use try-with-resources. But doing this means I have to increase the visibility of the implementer from protected to public which is not nice.Any thoughts? or better approach for this?",0

OOP: Which class should own a method?,"I’m having trouble understanding how classes relate to their methods. Is a method something that the object does, or something that’s done to it? Or is this a different concept entirely?Specifically, in a library’s software system, should the borrow() method belong to the class representing the library patron, or the class representing the item that the patron is borrowing? My intuition is that it should read like patron.borrow(copy), like English sentence structure, subject.verb(object); but my instructor says that’s Wrong, and I don’t understand why he would have borrow() belong to the Copy class (and he doesn’t really explain things too well). I’m not looking for justification, but can someone just explain the proper relationship?Edit: This question was closed as “off topic”. I don’t understand.

Is it possible to add custom metadata to .class files?,"We have used liquibase at our company for a while, and we've had a continuous integration environment set up for the database migrations that would break a job when a patch had an error.An interesting ""feature"" of that CI environment is that the breakage had a ""likely culprit"", because all patches need to have an ""author"", and the error message shows the author name.If you don't know what liquibase is, that's ok, its not the point.The point is: having a person name attached to a error is really good to the software development proccess: problems get addressed way faster.So I was thinking: Is that possible for Java stacktraces?Could we possibly had a stacktrace with peoples names along with line numbers like the one below?That kind of information would have to be pulled out from a SCM system (like performing ""svn blame"" for each source file).Now, forget about trashing the compilation time for a minute: Would that be even possible?To add metadata to class files like that?",0

Java: Multithreaded mail application leaks memory,"I have a self-written Java application - a little mail monitor. It works with a MySQL database that has a table which is filled somewhere else regularily. It looks through the table and sends mails as the records appear in the table.My problem is, the application leaks memory. I was quite sure that it didn't, as the scope of everything I use seems to disappear, making all objects used garbage collectable. But after a while (depending on the -Xmx I pass), the application stops with a OutOfHeapSpace error.I cannot post the whole code, as it is not mine anymore, yet I tried to recreate it using pseudo code.What I have tried so far:jvisualvm has shown me how the memory changes over time. What I see is a jagged line in the Heap: Allocating and collecting memory happens regularily, however, after the collection there's always a litttle more memory allocated than after the last collection. the number of Threads seem to be fine, it always drops down to the standard number.The information amount in jvisualvm is too much for me. There are threads listed there that I cannot identify, the threads I create are not listed as my class, so it's difficult to determine exactly what is ""my"" code.Can anybody recognize any common mistakes of multithreading in my pseudo code, or recommend any tools that allow me to determine my leaks easier?Thank you.Edit 1: Data access via the connection object which is passed around to all threads is synchronized on itself.Edit 2: I checked the number of mails that are unsendable (as these stay in the database), there are about 10.Edit 3: I found Eclipse Memory Analyzer, installed it, and it hinted at the problem. It seems that using PreparedStatements while retaining one connection object keeps a HashMap of all PreparedStatements ever run over this connection inside it, therefor adding all data ever selected to it. I relied on the PreparedStatement going out of scope and being collected. I will rewrite and try if this fixes the problem.",1

Reserve words in web.xml of servlet?,"I'm fairly new to servlets so I hope this isn't an obvious question.  So I have a simple Java servlet I've created in NetBeans using a template.

Looking at my logs, I see this at the top of a very long stacktrace:Line 19 column 146 indeed points to the ""version"" portion of that long URL I have in the list of context parameters.

Writing a custom eclipse debugger,"EDIT: There must be some way I can approach this without writing a whole new debugger. I'm currently looking into ways to build on top of the existing java debugger. If anyone has any ideas on how to grab information the Java debugger already has (about stack frames, variables, raw data etc.), that would be really helpful. --What I'm trying to do is I have this framework/API built on Java, and I would like to write an eclipse plugin debugger that is customized to my framework. Here is a simple example:I have two classes, one called scope and one called variable. The scope holds a map of variables. The code is all in java, but I'm using this scope-variable relationship almost like a new language, and would like a variable debug tab that gives me a list of currently active scopes with the variables that are currently stored inside. Here is some code:This is obviously an extremely simple example, but I would like to accomplish something similar to this where I can get a variables window, set a breakpoint, and have a ""debugger"" list out my active scope objects and the variable objects inside.

The classpath is correct, as it points to the m2 repo as it does to the other dependencies:Any suggestions would be appreciated.Thanks in advance!EDIT:SVNKit v1.3.5's manifest file is quite short compared to the other than I have in my referenced libraries:The other libraries have more information, such as export-package, bundle version, bundle name, import-packages, etc...

"Navigating around instantiating an abstract class, is there a flaw of in my OOP design?","After reading a number of questions regarding abstract classes and interfaces, I am still unsure about how I should go about designing my code, so at the risk of having missed a possible duplicate, here's my situation. I am working on a number of utility classes that are meant to handle a nasty hierarchy of a particular type of object. While the precise details of the object is irrelevant, it should suffice to say that it's not a general solution whatsoever. So I started by writing a CustomNode and a CustomHierarchy class. A bit later on I realized that it's much smarter to produce a more general solution, which can be reused in different context and easily tested without having to create lots of mock instances of the aforementioned complicated class. I could easily provide all the common code in interfaces and abstract classes, and just provide the specific bits where they are needed! (this I believe is the whole point with OOP?)So far I have:an interface Relatable which simply holds an enum of possible relations that nodes might have to one another, and a method signature of getRelation(Relatable other)an abstract class Node which implements the Relatable and contains all utility methods (e.g. addChild() or getNextSibling(). The only method this class is missing is the getRelation(Relatable other). a concrete class Hierarchy which will define how to build up the hierarchy of the nodes, starting from a Collection which holds the data.The idea is to extend the Node and Hierarchy classes with appropriate subclasses based on the problem at hand. The first two are done without any major hustle but I am having problems with the Hierarchy class since it has a private method addNodeToHierarchy(E data) which tries to instantiate a Node and place it in the hierarchy. This obviously fails as the node class is abstract and can't be instantiated. I understand why this is not working, but I am not sure how I should go about circumventing this problem. Is there a flaw in my design? Should I add a static createNewNode(E data) method in the Node and use that instead? Another option I can think of is to detach the Node from getting the relation and go with a Relator interface instead. This can't be a unique problem by any chance, so what's ""good practice"" in this situation?Thanks in advance,",1
Java: How to mirror console output to file,"I need to monitor console output in Java, I have tried several different ways of retrieving the output as it is streamed, but I fell into a few pitfalls (looping the same output, only one part of output being captured, losing output) and have decided to go about it a different way. I am developing a Java plugin for a server of the popular game, Minecraft, and I need to be able to monitor console output from other plugins.  I think a good way to do this is by redirecting console output to file, and then set up a recurring async task that checks the file, carries out anything it needs to do, and then clears the file for more input. I think I can do this with a simple use of System.setOut(PrintStream stream); and one of the many guides I can find on Google.But there is a problem, and that is why I am asking here today. I need console output to stay on the console like normal, hence ""mirroring"". I cannot edit any of the plugins to output somewhere else, it needs to be from what my Java plugin can do and that only. Sure, maybe on every scheduled check on the file I could reprint it all back to the console but that would result in blocks being printed at a time, which would not be ideal. I do hope this is possible. Thank you!EDIT: I don't think I explained fully. ""plugins""'s classes are run by the program that I am developing for. I cannot change how classes are run and I cannot change how other plugins print to console.I also do not want to direct console output to files for logging, that idea is only to keep it in a temporary place while it is parsed. Ideally, I need to pass each line of console output to a function (parseString(String line)) which carries out operations depending on the contents of the line. Also, I don't understand how I can read stream contents line-by-line properly, so if someone has any idea on how to, please let me know. :)",1
handling touch events in Android when using multiple views/layouts,"I'm very new to Android programming, and trying to understand touch events with nested views.

How to run maven compile phase with test-jar dependencies,"The project I'm working on is made of multiple modules, being built with maven.The test code in some modules has dependencies on test code from other modules.These dependencies are declared as below.In the dependency module:    org.apache.maven.plugins    maven-jar-plugin    2.2                                        test-jar                        In the module which has the dependency on the previous module:    ${project.groupId}    themodulename    ${project.version}    test-jar    testUsing this configuration, the maven install phase can be executed successfully.But trying to run the compile or test phase fails, because the test jar file dependency cannot be resolved.Looking at the test-jar goal, it seems to be configured to run by default during the package phase, which I think is the cause of the problem.Then, I tried to force this goal to run during the compile phase, by modifying the first config into:    org.apache.maven.plugins    maven-jar-plugin    2.2                        compile                            test-jar                        Looking at the debug logs, I can see that the goal is now executed during the compile phase, but also this:I tried to configure the includes to **/* and confirmed that the default testClassesDirectory was set to the right one, but I still get the same warning.I could see that the test-classes folder didn't exist after running the compile phase, which seems normal, but even though it exists after running the test phase, and it contains files, I still get the ""JAR will be empty"" warning.Does anyone have any idea on fixing this configuration so that I can run successfully the compile or test phase?",0

Sphinx4 Beta API Problems With Eclipse,"I'm trying to set up a simple helloworld demo with Sphinx 4.0 (which is apparently a beta?) I downloaded the source and added it as source to Eclipse, but the problem is, it doesn't recognize a lot of the classes. I've been looking, and as far as I can tell, the classes it wants just aren't there! For example, the line:throws a compiler error, saying something about how the import couldn't be resolved. Is this a part of a bigger API I was supposed to download before trying to do Sphinx4? It didn't say anything about any other API but I'm open to the possibility.If you want, I can post a list of all the imports that can't be resolved, I will, but that means looking through all the code which is kind of a pain. I have a hunch that I need to download the JSAPI, but I don't know which implementation would be good for Sphinx4.Links to Sphinx4 downloads:[http://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/sphinx4/1.0%20beta6/](""http://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/sphinx4/1.0%20beta6/"")[http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/](""http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/"")EDIT: In addition, I've found a few lines that I think might mean I need to download JUnit?

Eclipse Plugin for creating large java class diagrams from existing code,"I am looking for an Eclipse Plugin to create large class diagrams from existing Java code (free/open source).I found some plugins that create diagrams from java code and vice-versa, but the project has a large number of packages (about 80) and classes/interfaces (about 1000-1500) and I would like to create a diagram for the whole code, with different options (for eg, not to include the interfaces in the generated diagram or to create diagrams for certain packages).I know that the diagram would be very big, but that is what I really want to represent the project in a single diagram (and omitting unimportant classes, interfaces, packages etc and also members and method names).",0
Can I compile a Scala project with mixed java and scala code with dependencies both ways in Maven?,"I have a project which has both scala and java code which I am currently managing in eclipse using the scala IDE plugin. At present the directory structure is organized such that some packages have both java and scala code in them. There are scala classes which depend on java classes and there are other java classes which depend on the scala classes. The plugin handles all of this transparently – I believe (but I’m not 100% sure) that the scala compiler compiles both the java and scala code together which is how the cross dependencies are handled. I did find some references to compiling mixed projects using Maven e.g. here but the ones I saw talking about separating the java and scala into two separate source trees. Maven attempts to compile the scala code first which fails because of the dependencies on the java code. Likewise, if the java code were compiled first it would also fail as the dependencies go both ways. Is there a way to have Maven compile all the code together like the eclipse plugin? I’d also like to have the ability to generate an eclipse project without doing too much manual fix-up afterwards if possible.",0

java hw Need Help to understand,"I'll write down the whole problem first.  A ring is a collection of items that has a reference to a current item. An operation -- let's call it advance--moves the reference to the next item in the collection. When the reference reaches the last item, the next advance operation will move the reference back to the first item. A ring also has operations to get the current item, add an item, and remove an item. The details of where an item is added and which one is removed are up to you.    Design an ADT(Abstract Data Type) to represent a ring of objects. Specify each operation by stating its purpose, by describing its parameters, and by writing a pseudocode version of its header. Then write a Java interface for a ring's methods. Include javadoc-style comments in your code.So is it saying the Ring is like a class with operation that can move items by using a reference variable like T = items? And Advance would change T to represent a different item each time it's being called? Something like in UML format....ADT: RingAm I on the right track or am I supposed to do something else?",0

"Memory Leak on stop or redeploy - Spring 3.1.2, Hibernate 4.1.0, Spring Data-Jpa 1.1.0, Tomcat 7.0.30","EDIT 12013/06/07 - While I'm still having this problem, once again, it is still only affecting redeploys. Since the original question was posted, we've upgraded a few things. Here are our new version (which still exhibit the issue at hand):As you can see, it's basically just a Spring Framework bump and Spring (Data) Jpa bump. We also moved up to Tomcat 7.0.39. CGLIB (which wasn't mentioned before but was included) has also been bumped to 3.0Here are some of the things I've tried to remedy the problem at hand with no luck:Changed up our POM (using Maven) to set our database driver to have its scope as providedAdded dependency for SLF4J to included jul-to-slf4j as it was mentioned that there could be a potential leak hereTried out a Classload Leak Protector ([https://github.com/mjiderhamn/classloader-leak-prevention](""https://github.com/mjiderhamn/classloader-leak-prevention"")). This appeared to have worked (as it spammed my logs during undeploy/shutdown by listing a ton of things it was cleaning up) but after using VisualVM, my perm gen space was not reclaimed. This may be useful for others...Tried to list all the exclusions in my POM by using Maven's dependency analysis tool (In IntelliJ in the Maven Projects window, you can right click the dependencies and select 'Show Dependencies' and Shift-Delete all the red dependencies). This didn't help, but it decrease my WAR file size by about a MB or so.Refactored the JPA Persistence configuration as follows (notice the comments) based upon an unresolved bug report from Spring ([https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-9274](""https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-9274"")):Created a 'ThreadImmolator' as per [Is this very likely to create a memory leak in Tomcat?](""https://stackoverflow.com/a/15710827/941187"">https://stackoverflow.com/a/15710827/941187)'. This appeared to do nearly the same thing as the TreadLocal Leak Detection above -- I didn't have the Tomcat Leak detector complaining; however, perm gen space was still not recovered after redeploy.My first attempt was to add a @PreDestory in my WebConfig (same bean that has @EnableWebMvc) to attempt to trigger it on close. Perm. Gen remained.My second attempt was to subclass the ContextLoaderListener, override the ContextDestoryed() and inline the functions. Perm. Gen remained.Since the ThreadImmolator didn't help (or appeared not to help), I tried the solution suggested in [How to clean up threadlocals](""https://stackoverflow.com/a/16644476"">https://stackoverflow.com/a/16644476)'.

How to map code points to unicode characters depending on the font used?,"The client prints labels and has been using a set of symbolic (?) fonts to do this. The application uses a single byte database (Oracle with Latin-1). The old application I am replacing was not Unicode aware. It somehow did OK. The replacement application I am writing is supposed to handle the old data.The symbols picked from the charmap application often map to particular Unicode characters, but sometimes they don't. What looks like the Moon using the LAB3 font, for example, is in fact U+2014 (EM DASH). When users paste this character into a Swing text field, the character has the code point 8212. It was ""moved"" into the Private Use Area (by Windows? Java?). When saving this character to the database, Oracle decides that it cannot be safely encoded and replaces it with the dreaded ¿. Thus, I started shifting the characters by 8000: -= 8000 when saving, += 8000 when displaying the field. Unfortunately I discovered that other characters were not shifted by the same amount. In one particular font, for example, ž has the code point 382, so I shifted it by +/-256 to ""fix"" it.By now I'm dreading the discovery of more strange offsets and I wonder: Can I get at this mapping using Java? Perhaps the TTF font has a list of the 255 glyphs it encodes and what Unicode characters those correspond to and I can do it ""right""?Right now I'm using the following kludge:",1
How can I get the height of the title bar of a JInternalFrame?,"How can I find out the height of the title bar of a JInternalFrame? It would be preferable to do this in an OS and L&amp;F independent manner.I have seen this [, which seems to be asking a similar question but for JDialog. However, the answers seem to suggest using the Container method getInsets(), for which the javadoc](""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7969254/get-height-of-jdialog-title-bar"">SO) states:  Determines the insets of this container, which indicate the size of the container's border.    A Frame object, for example, has a top inset that corresponds to the height of the frame's title bar.Unfortunately, JInternalFrame is not a Frame, but a JComponent. As such, this only provides the size of the border. In the previous SO question, it was asked what the use case is... so let me explain mine. I want to create JInternalFrames, popped up at the point of the mouse click, and sized to some maximum/minimum criteria, including that it is no larger than currently visible space to the bottom-right of the mouse click within the parent frame.Consider the following SSCCE:As you will see if you run this, the internal popups are sized to fit the width, but not the height - i.e. the height exceeds the frame size by... the height of the JInternalFrame's title bar. As such, I want to find out this height, so that I can set the size of the JInternalFrame appropriately.",1

Cannot debug project created with NB6.9.1 within NB7+ (has JAR dependency which uses JNI),"I just tried to migrate our working Java projects from Netbeans 6.9.1 to Netbeans 7.2 and I'm experiencing a problem due to one of our project dependencies being an external JAR which uses JNI.I created a copy of our project directory and simply opened the copies of NB projects originally created with the older version of the IDE. Everything went smooth. I can build the projects and run compiled executable JAR-s outside of Netbeans without any problems.However when I try to debug the project, the application fails to init properly due to said dependency JAR with JNI. It's like the JAR is failing to find a DLL associated with it (giving me java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError as a result). This does not happen with 6.9.1!Why would this be happening? Do I need to explicitly set java.library.path in NB7+?There were no changes made to the projects (not by us) and the same JDK is being used in both versions of the IDE. I suspect the newer version applies changes to the project setup silently and breaks something in the process.

class diagram confusion (trivial),"I think this is relatively simple, but I am just confused since I am new with class diagrams.I am about to create a program (in Java) about managing the types of employee in McDonalds.

To make the classes distinguishable, I also thought of adding a type of bonus on each ""CrewMember"" and ""Superviser"" but I don't think that would be flexible, if in future, the bonus and the type of bonus would change.

Adjusting repaints in JComponent to improve performance,"I am trying to do some tests on 2D ""game""-programming by trying out different concepts to approach both designing and visualizing the environment.In my baby-steps I went to go with Swing and using a JComponent's paintComponent() method to retrieve a Graphics2D object that I then use to visualize my game board.It works quite well but I got to the point where I need to repeatedly check my whole game-model and update the view, basically once every 1/10 second something can change.I paint the visuals by calling repaint() on my JComponent to cause a complete update of the view: I check every tile my game board has for information and paint that tile according to this data, for every tile on the board. But as I approach about 1000 - 4000 tiles that need to be painted, I come to the point where the painting of the whole view takes more than 100ms and thus a constant lag occurs when doing anything.Now for the question(s): I am looking for a way, or opinions, on how to improve the performance of this approach. As not every tile on the board changes every ""tick"" I do not need to ""repaint"" this tile. But on the contrary, moving the visual area (camera offset) changes the position of every tile on the screen, so it would need to be repainted at a different position. Also, the later implementation of ""would be"" animations would need a constant update of the visual area, regardless of ""happenings"" or not. When looking at 3D games with high quality graphics (or even simple ones like minecraft) running at > 30 FPS, I am wondering weather or not I should immediately switch to OpenGL before running into even more problems graphics wise, or are there ways to improve the performance with algorithms checking for the right kind of changes both in the view and the model?",0

Designing a program with statistics,"I am about to start my newest project, it is basicly an application that gets some data from a database and then display that data a graph!now even though that this may seem simple it is important to me that this is done in a very correct way when it comes to object orientated programming.Now my idea was the following:I wanted to create the following four classes:Adapter:The class that connects the application to the database and recives the dataCallQueue:This is an object that differences depending on what type of data is recived from the database and what type of data you wish to show on your graph. An example of this would be Cheese and fruits. both of them are food but they are very different types of food.StatisticsThis would be a tool class used to calculate the information recived from the database (for example changeing it to percentage instead of raw data)GraphThis would be the class that gets the information from the statistic class and turns the numbers into a graphGUIThis is ofcourse the GUI class where i will post the graph on!Now i want to make the project as object orientated as possible. But my problem is that the information from the database is not always the same. For example if get the data from a day to day basis it will be different than from month to month. This means that the information is always going to change depending on what the user need.How would i make this program object orientated ? and what type of connections should my classes have to eachother to make it most accessible. Do i have to create subclasses in order to simplify it? should i add all information from the datbase directly into the CallQueue Class or should that object be created later on?Update - ElaborationThe name callQueue is not a streaming implementation it is marely an object that should contain values of the data recived from the database (note that this is still in the idea phase and nothing is implemented). The idea is that a user opens the program and then chooses a day from and then a day to for instance: 04/11/2012 to 10/11/2012. The reason the objects value changes is when the day changes for instance to the following: 04/11/2012 - 04/12/2012 then a new graph will be created new information from the database will be calculated ect ect.One thing that i am confused about aswell is the following:When you have an object that is created from the database (adapater Note this could be optimized if you guys have a better idea) then how would you calculate statistics from that? would it be better that the statistic class called the adapter for data then worked with the data and then created the objects contain the calculated data?Then the Graph class would need to get the objects data and insert into the graph.",0

"Swing Timer Tick erratic, not regular","I am rather new to Java but not programming in general.  I am using Java 1.7.0_07 on Windows Vista.

Make java methods visible to only specific classes,"I have a manager class that is responsible for managing Objects of a certain kind. To do so it needs to manipulate these Objects, but these Objects have no relation to the manager whatsoever, so design technically, they are in separate packages ""project.managers"" and ""project.objects"" . The important thing is that the Objects in question should only be manipulated by the managers and nowhere else, but need to be accessible by every other class in the project.As such I'd like to have the managers have access to manipulating methods, but restrict access to every other class. The most obvious one would be to move the manager class and object class into the same package and declare manipulating methods protected, but as the managers and objects are completely separate entities they don't fit there philosophically.(This is partly because I want my IDE to stop showing me the manipulating methods whenever I autocomplete code on the Objects in question so I always have to go the route through the manager so corresponding tables are correctly updated whenever I change the Objects in question).Are there any ideas to that or is the obvious way the best in any case?",0

Composition - Will not exist if the object is destroyed. for example a Room can't exist without a House.3.) Association - I am not sure, at what instances we should use this. Can someone comment on this.When it comes to writing Java codes for Aggregation, COmposition and Association4.) AggregationI think that if it's an Aggregation association, then there should be accessors and mutators defined. Is this correct ?According to my definition of Aggregation, i mentioned that if the Car object is destroyed, the Engine can be accessed. But, i don't see that hapenning in the above code. If Car object is destroyed, there will not be any way to access the Engine like car.getEngine(). So how does this happen ?CompositionI think that if it's a C0mposition, then there should not be any accessor mutator functions. and the Object Room has to be created only inside the Constructor. and  the instance method that holds the room object must be Private ?

Maven release plugin and globally defined dependency versions,"I'm not sure whether the title makes a whole lot of sense and whether this post already answers my question, but here it is:We have a multi-module project. As you would expect this projects has a combination of internal and third party dependencies. For the third party dependencies we define these in the dependency management section of our parent POM so that we can manage the versions of these dependencies in a single common place.As for inter-project (internal) dependencies, so far we've just entered the versions within each modules POM where a dependency is required. Then when doing a prepare with the release plugin, these versions are updated appropriately - all very nice.What we want, like with the third party dependencies, is to be able to specify the internal dependency versions in the parent POM and therefore have a single common place. I see three potential approaches.We do this by creating a property in the parent POM.We do it via the dependency management section in the parent POM.We use the project version property as the dependency version.The preference would be to use one of the first two approaches, though there isn't really a strong reason for this. This leads me onto the main concern and question: If we use either of the first two approaches, will the release plugin still update the dependency version during the prepare stage?All thoughts/feedback appreciated.",0

Maven: Export jar with 3rd-party jars added to classpath in manifest,"I am developing a Java maven project with Eclipse and want to export a jar that includes all referenced libraries. These referenced libraries fall into one of these two categories:They are explicit (or implicit) dependencies in the pom.xmlI have some libraries not available as maven artifacts and have put them in /lib (and added them to the build path in Eclipse)There's the maven-assembly-plugin, which works fine for 1). However, I'm unable to find a maven plugin that also includes non-maven-dependencies, e.g. ""all jars in /lib"".Then there's the Eclipse FatJar plugin, which sort of works, but hasn't been updated since 2009, so it seems unmaintained. Also I prefer an export method that I can directly specify in the pom.xml.Can anyone point me to a maven plugin or the like to export all referenced libraries, including those from case 2) ? That only needs to involve putting them in the jar and referencing them in the manifest's classpath.Thanks!",0

"Java 2D game, Both of my rectangles are moving when only one should move","I have coded a simple Java game where there are two rectangles on the screen, one of the rectangles should move and the other should stays still, the moving Rectangle moves with keyboard arrow input and can move either up, down, left or right. The problem I am having is that both rectangles are moving when only one of them should (rectOne) and rectTwo should stay still, I have my variables set up as shown:the coordinates variables buckyPositionX and buckyPositionY are 0,0 so they show the two left corner of my screen and the coordinate variables shiftX and shiftY show the coordinates at the centre of the screen so that the moving rectangle is always centred.The Play class which has all of the game code inside of it is made up of a few methods, the important ones are update and render, the update deals with the rectangle movement speeds and keyboard inputs to show you an example of what is inside the update class, here is a sample of the code for when they up key is pressed:That is done for all keyboard arrow inputs. Next is the render method which deals with drawing everything on the screen and the graphics, this method includes drawing the rectangles on the screen which were previously coded with the variables.So, I have two rectangles drawn on the screen when I try move the rectangle with the keyboard input both the rectangles move together at the same time, I think there is a problem with how I have set up my rectangle coordinates and have tried playing about with them for example removing the +buckyPositionX and +buckyPositionY from them but the same problem occurs, if you have any ideas of what may solve this problem please tell me.Thank you in advance.Edit1: Here is my full code for my play class as requested:ANSWERING QUESTIONS:The reason I used the variables buckyPositionX and buckyPositionY in my rectTwo variables is because when I try to draw this using the g.fillRect function everything works fine with those inputs, rectOne moves and RectTwo stays still but when I call the exact same rectangles from the variables by saying g.fillRect(rectOne.X,rectOne.Y...) I get this problem where both the rectangles are moving together which is strange because the coordinates and the sizes are the exact same as when they are drawn using g.fillRect(500 + buckyPositionX, 330 + buckyPositionY, 210, 150) and same for rectOne. I will try make it more clear with some code:If I use this in my variables:and this in my render method:Both of the rectangles, rectOne and rectTwo move together.but if I use this in my render method without having any variable set:Everything works VISUALLY although my collisions dont work with this method (which is why I want to fix it) the rectangles both appear on the screen and rectOne moves whilst rectTwo stays still.I will make a new post explaining my problem in more detail as this one has started getting too crowded and off topic.",1

Getting SonaType's release plugin to behave when using git. Or better alternatives?,"Note: long question, so in essence: I wish to know how to release, via maven, a sanctified release of an existing project under my control. I use sonatype and its plugin at the moment, but their release plugin just won't let me push a SHA1 as a release. If ready-made solutions exist, I adopt them any day, provided you tell me how to modify my pom.xml, linked belowI have a Java project (available on [GitHub](""https://github.com/fge/json-schema-validator"") and in use already) which I develop using Intellij IDEA 12.0.1 (community version) on Ubuntu 12.10, 64bit. The installed version of maven is the one bundled by my distribution (3.0.4).The problem I have lies with the pom.xml of the project:[https://raw.github.com/fge/json-schema-validator/master/pom.xml](""https://raw.github.com/fge/json-schema-validator/master/pom.xml"")I followed [SonaType's release guide](""https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide""). I have set up GPG, etc, all work OK. I can release using their plugin which, I surmise, is triggered by the following lines in pom.xml:However, I have several problems with this plugin (but is it really that one?):it creates garbage commits, always prefixed with [mvn-release-plugin], and I don't want that;it clones from the developerConnection URI each time it wants to release, which is, frankly, stupid for anyone knowing how git works (a simple fetch and SHA1 compare can detect discrepancies) -- and this behaviour is all the more annoying that my net connection is poor, to put it mildly;it asks to create a tag: I don't want that, I can create it myself, thank you very much;it won't even let you customize the release commit message (and I want to include a shortlog in there).Therefore, when I am ready for a release, I go through these steps:create a tag on HEAD, called beforegit cherry-pick a commit (which I know the SHA1 of) which replaces, in pom.xml, all git repository URIs to a local repository of mine, which I sync as needed;at the shell prompt, let the plugin to its stuff so that the release get available ""at large"":git rebase before: get rid of the commit changing the git URIs, squash/reword etc so that the garbage commits disappear and that the release message contains a shortlog of changes instead;create the real tag;push to github.Of course, this means that the Maven release, which I guarantee to be sound and sane, does not match the SHA1 of the equivalent version on the Github project. And I'd like to get rid of that discrepancy.So, how do I get the Sonatype release plugin to behave? That is, how do I tell it to:trust the local git repository instead of git cloneing from developerConnection,not create useless commits,let me customize the release message?Or is there a better alternative which would allow me not to go through this cumbersome processs?Details available on demand.",0

Change wsimport binding file to point to local resource,"I am currently working in a project, where we want to automate web service client generation using Maven's jaxws-maven-plugin. Right now, web service clients are generated using the IBM RAD 8.0 internal tool for web service client generation.This works fine, but with the increasing number of Webservices, the process becomes too slow. Though we can get the Maven plugin to generate the Java classes in the client project and use them in local development with local server, the validation of the web service fails when we try to deploy it.That is due to the server infrastructure, where projects need to step through test, stage and production servers, being deployed further, when tests ran successully on each of the servers. Upon deployment, the Websphere Portal Servr tries to validate the generated web service client against the WSDL definition given in the binding Java file that is generated in the package. When running the maven plugin, the following bindung is produced:MyProjectHttpServiceBecause the generated web project needs to run on each server from the very same EAR file, we cannot change the URL in the WSDL file between the servers. RAD's importing tool produces a binding file that uses the classloader to get the files:MyProjectHttpServiceIn order to find a solution we went as far as writing our own Maven plugin that downloads the XSD and WSDL files and puts them in the build package, so they could be used to generate the web service client with the wsimport plugin afterwards, but using  instead of . However, this was not successull as well, as the binding file would be produced with an absolute path:Any help on how we can resolve the problem would be welcome. We don't really care on how we can achieve the result of having all of the XSD and WSDL file inside our jar, being referenced relatively, so the environment doesn't matter when the webserver tries to validate the web service client.PS: Sadly, we also cannot use multiple profiles for the different environments.",0

How to modify Java Control Panel selections (corresponding to deployment.properties file) from windows command prompt?,"How to modify Java Control Panel selections (corresponding to deployment.properties file) from windows command prompt?Specifically, I am looking for command(s) which can effect change in ""Action for local applets"" selection, in ""Custom Security Level Settings"" window (click the ""Settings..."" button next to ""Custom"" setting for the ""Security Level"" slider in the Security tab in Java Control Panel), from ""Prompt user"" to ""Run without prompt"". This setting's default value changed with update 11 of Java 7 and it interferes with operation of an automated-test program, which I am fixing now, by having a Security Warning dialog window pop-up when IE starts java.exe, unless this Java Control Panel setting is adjusted a priori. This test program launches IE to run a local Java applet, which is written using AWT, and which doesn't access any websites.Note, this problem has been discussed recently -- see [https://service.parachat.com/knowledgebase/273/I-see-a-Do-you-want-to-run-this-application-security-warning.html](""https://service.parachat.com/knowledgebase/273/I-see-a-Do-you-want-to-run-this-application-security-warning.html"")For my task, modifying this Java Control Panel setting manually is the least desirable way to solve the problem because the program, which I am fixing, is a part of an automated test suite, which is deployed on many machines, and requiring manual intervention makes the deployment process error-prone. I need these commands to run from a windows command prompt batch file.I found that these security level selections are recorded in Java deployment.properties file and in 2 Windows registry under keys with names ending in ""Software\JavaSoft\DeploymentProperties"".deployment.properties file is discussed comprehensively in [Oracle Java SE Documentation ""Deployment Configuration File and Properties""](""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/deployment/deployment-guide/properties.html"") but nothing obvious is mentioned about ""Action for local applets"", maybe because this property is a recent addition (?)When I adjust Java Security Level and ""Action for local applets"" in the Java Control Panel, I see the changes reflected in the deployment.properties file as well as in the DeploymentProperties registry keys.So I can do the following:adjust the deployment.properties file via script (saving the original)start Java Control Panel via script -- I observed that this copies the updates from the deployment.properties file to the registry keys DeploymentPropertiesterminate the javaw process which runs the Java Control Panelthen run the program which uses my local Java applet within IEthen revert the deployment.properties file to the original, start Java Control Panel via script, and terminate the javaw process which runs the Java Control Panel.I also tried it vice versa -- update the registry key -- but the file does not change and Java Control Panel reverts the registry keys' value set back to agree with the unmodified deployment.properties file! So updating the registry keys is a wrong way to do it.Is there a better way to do this? My 3-step solution above (to modify the properties) is a kluge for what it is meant to accomplish. Is there a Java command-line utility which can modify a given deployment property? Is there a way to pass these deployment properties to JVM via applet tag's attributes, to be effective only within the given Java applet?I used Windows XP (both 32-bit and 64-bit) and Windows 7 (64-bit) and Internet Explorer 7, 8 and 9. It would be good to have a (simple) solution which works on Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8.",1

Where can I find resources for how to Model for Java in Eclipse that is easy to understand?,"I have used eclipse to work on C++ in the past, and I am new to Java, and I get the basics there for the most part.

Then, if I change some objects around, it would update the code.

EMF XMI Acceleo EIB RDB GMF XML UML ... woah!, woah!, hold on there, I can figure something out if it make sense, but this feels like a government employee got a hold of it, acronyms everywhere!

How to parse last parenthesis?,"So if I have an expression enclosed by a pair of parenthesis with anything in between or outside the parenthesis, how can I remove the outermost pair of parenthesis, use recursion and call parseFactor (every time I see a set of parenthesis I call parseFactor)? Since this is very vague, I'll give you an example of what I mean. Take this JUST FOR EXAMPLE (It is not a specific problem I am trying to solve, just a general idea):If I have the expression   ((4+1)*1) + 5  I want to break this down so that I first get (4+1)*1 (Whatever is in the first pair of parenthesis). Then, call the parseFactor function again because I see another set of parenthesis, and then parseFactor, which calls parseExpression, will do the calculations inside using recursion. So that means I get 5*1. I then do the calculations of that with the function parseTerm and get 5. Once I get out of the recursion I get 5+5 I then call another function called parseExpression, which will calculate 5+5 and return 10.Currently, I am using Matcher m = Pattern.compile(""\\((.*)"").matcher(expr)).find() in parseFactor and then group the result to remove the first parenthesis, leading me with (4+1)*1) + 5. I call parseFactor again to get 4+1)*1) + 5. The problem is I don't know how to get rid of the outer parenthesis. Here's my code for reference, if anyone needs it:where expr is the string to be parsed and broken down and calculated. This code came from my parseExpression function. findInt() just returns the first integer it finds within the string.EDIT: I have to use regex.",1

"Is the driver class (Main class) an association, aggregation, or composition?","I've been wondering what kind of relationship the main class (controlling all the other classes in a non-GUI program) has with the other classes? for example a class which is instantiated in the class containing the main method and classes which the main method interacts with such as getting a return value.EDIT: Should it even be included in the UML? because my professor includes it (I didn't even know it was called a driver class) and the book im reading apparently doesn't include it, no this isn't homework. It could be an association because it interacts with it. It can also be an aggregation because its made up of several of a class. And a class doesn't make sense without it (in the program implementation) so I think its composition because composition is an aggregation and aggregation in turn is a type of association. Although several responses already posted sound like my answer is wrong.",0
Crypting and Securing Android data,"My app picks up the GPS location of the user every 5 minutes, saves it and then sends it to a server.The problem I'm facing is I need the data stored on the android SD card to be Crypted so no one except me on the server can access it.

So really all I want to do is download he's latest commits.EDIT : My solution was that my partner was working in a copy of the local git workspace.

Strategies for debugging a runtime Java crash that runs correctly in NetBeans,"Sorry in advance. This is a really vague question because I have no idea whatsoever what is going on.

I built the application and put it on another computer. I then went to run the program (outside of NetBeans) straight from the jar file. While in the new areas (JDialog boxes), the program crashes. Since I am not in an IDE, I have no feedback to see what is wrong.The only thing that I can think of (and this is lame) is that I added some switch statements that switch on strings, which I know to new to 1.7. I was previously developing in 1.6. Otherwise, I can think of no reason that the program should work flawlessly inside the IDE, but crash outside of it.Can anyone offer any suggestions for how I should approach this?

It cycles trough a bunch of JTextAreas, and removes empty ones.So what's the catch?Each time JTextArea is removed, a listener is triggered which then visually updates the GUI (pulls all visual object below the JTextArea up).So what happens? Well, as the loop is being executed, JTextAreas are not being removed visually, they are being added to the EDT que (I'm guessing), and then they are all removed at once after the loop is done. What happens then is that all of the listeners fire at once and mess up the whole GUI.Since everything is ran on the EDT, I expected the code to act like this:Start cycleFind an empty JTextAreaCompletly remove an empty JTextArea -> triggers the listenerExecute the code in the listenerContinue the loopFind the next empty JTextAreaRinse and repeat until end of loop is reachedHow can I force my program to act like this?Should I create a new thread that searches for the blank JTextAreas, and have the removals be done in invokeLater(new Runnable())?The actual code that does the search is really not CPU intentsive, it only goes trough arrayList of JTextAreas and check is getText().equals(""""), so I don't really think that's necessary...",1

How to overcome hardware limitations when reading/writing to a file.,"I was asked this question in an interview recently.   Given an input file, a regex and an output file. Read the input file, match each line to the regex and write the matching lines to an output file.  I came up with the rough scheme of using a BufferedReader chained to a FileReader (to optimize Reads from the disk). I used a similar scheme for writing.   The interviewer then said that this process takes 3 seconds to read a line from the file, 1 second to compare the regex with the line and another 5 seconds to write back. so it takes a total of 9 seconds per line. How can we improve this? I suggested reading the entire file at once, processing it and writing the entire output file at once. However, I was told that won't help (Writing 1 line = 5 seconds, writing 2 lines = 10 seconds) .  The interviewer further said that this is due to a hardware/ hard drive limitation. I was asked how I can improve my code to reduce the total seconds (currently 9 ) per line? I could only think of buffered reading/ writing and could not find much on SO as well. Any thoughts ? ",0

Create Java Annotation to replace a token with code,"I'm doing a project which in essence is a way for a user to create macros for very long/repetitive code so they can then put these macros into a their code to increase readability and encourage re-usability.The project is split up into two areas: an RCP application where the user constructs their macros and saves them to file, and a plugin-in in eclipse where a user can insert a macro.The RCP application has come along nicely, but now I'm getting to the real bit where I want java to look at a piece of code and at compile time go 'Oh, that piece of code means this'.For example a user could have created a macro with an identifier macro1 that represents the code System.out.println(""Hello World"");. They want to use it in their class foo which will look like:I want the user to run their class, and when Java compiles it replace macro1 with it's value.I have been looking into this for a while and read up a little bit on JavaCC and looked into Ants Replace Task but I feel I want to go down the road of creating a custom annotation to inform Java that this string below the annotation should be transformed into/replaced by a piece of java code located in a specific text file. Hopefully ending up with something like:To me it seems like it could be possible but I don't know if I'm just being too optimistic! :)Also one of my concerns is how deployable would it be as a plugin?

Eclipse autobuilding Android project badly,"My Eclipse seems to have corrupted itself/my project. I renamed the id's of some TextViews in the XML and it changed the id's of some other TextViews in other XML files, causing many null pointer exceptions. When I try to rename them, the change the the new name, but then jump to something completely random which already exists. It has completely broken my project so I'll have to start afresh, however does anybody know what could have caused this?ThanksEDIT: As I am editing ID's, it would appear that some elements are sharing an ID. Everytime I change one, it changes the other one. I think this is because Eclipse generates TextViews and calls them TextView01 etc.. and it's linked all the ones it called TextView01 together.

How to make swing controls in netbeans by default protected or public?,My first question is - can we make the swing controls (like textfield or combobox) public or protected in netbeans?

We cannot use them in other classes.Second one is - Is there any other way by which we can use the components of one frame in other class?For example - In one frame we have one textfield one button and one label only.

JamVM on Motorola FX9500 Problems - what should I do?,"I am using a [Motorola FX9500](""http://www.motorola.com/Business/US-EN/Business+Product+and+Services/RFID/RFID+Readers/FX9500_US-EN"") RFID reader, which runs Linux with the [jamvm](""http://jamvm.sourceforge.net/"") version 1.5.0 on it (I can only deploy applications to it - I cannot change the Java VM or anything so my options are limited) - here's what I see when I check the version:I need to write an application so I grabbed the Oracle Java SDK 1.5.0 and installed it onto my Windows 7 PC, so it has this version:Am I being too idealistic in considering that an application I compile with that compiler would work correctly on the aforementioned JamVM?  Anyway, pressing on in ignorance I write this little application:Compile it with the aforementioned javac compiler and run it on the PC like so:All fine there.  Life is good, so I take that .class file and place it on the [FX9500](""http://www.motorola.com/Business/US-EN/Business+Product+and+Services/RFID/RFID+Readers/FX9500_US-EN"") and run it like so:Eek, what the...as you can see - it returns a different result.  So, why and who's wrong or is this something like the specification is not clear about how to deal with this calculation (surely not)?  Could it be that I need to compile it with a different compiler?Why Do I Care About This?The reason I came to this situation is that a calculation exactly like that happens inside java.lang.Long.toString and I have a bug in my real application where I am logging out a long and getting a java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.  Because the value I am wanting to log may very well be at the ends of a Long.I think I can work around it by checking for Long.MIN_VALUE and Long.MAX_VALUE and logging ""Err, I can't tell you the number but it is really Long.XXX, believe me, would I lie to you?"".  But when I find this, I feel like my application is built on a sandy foundation now and it needs to be really robust.  I am seriously considering just saying that JamVM is not up to the job and writing the application in Python (since the reader also has a Python runtime).I'm kind of hoping that someone tells me I'm a dullard and I should have compiled it on my Windows PC like .... and then it would work, so please tell me that (if it is true, of course)!UpdateNoofiz got me thinking (thanks) and I knocked up this additional test application:I, again, compile on the Windows machine and run it.It prints Phew, that was a close one I copy the .class file to the contraption in question and run it.It prints......wait for it...W....T.....FOh dear.  I feel a bit woozy, I think I need a cup of tea...Update 2One other thing I tried, that did not make any difference, was to copy the classes.zip and glibj.zip files off of the FX9500 to the PC and then do a cross compile like so (that must mean the compiled file should be fine right?):But the resulting .class file, when run on the reader prints the same message.",1

JPA Collection Using Map,"So I have a small proof of concept using JPA, Hibernate and Spring Data.  In this POC I have created a Post entity and a Comment entity.  The Post entity contains a map of comments Map.I was having issues persisting multiple Comment entities into the Map since I used the Comment entities @Id column as the key for the map.  Basically, if I didn't explicitly set the id of the Comment Hibernate recognized them as the same entity and only persisted one of them.I found I could persist the Map by specifying garbage keys, which MySql autonumber would replace once persisted.  This led to an issue, the keys within the current map would not receive the new commentId values set by the database.  This caused my unit test to fail.So basically I have three questions?Should I specify garbage keys to persist the entities in the map?Is my approach all wrong?  If so, whats a better way?If garbage keys are ok, how can I refresh them after insert?Post.javaComment.javaUnit TestAlso note that this is a bidirectional relationship",1

Lock dependencies by secure checksum in Maven,"When I distribute a source project with a POM I can define dependencies with version strings.

How to pass two objects to use in a form using thymeleaf?,"My problem is the following : I've 2 differents objects that I've to fill from a single form. With 1 object, I simply do in the newFoo.html:         Goand in the FooController: Let's say I've an other object bar with a ""status"" variable in it. How can I do to pass that object so I can submit the input within the same form? Like:             GoSo far I tried to do with to fieldset with a th:object in it, that doesn't work, I tried to put two th:object in the form, that doesn't work either. The only way I found is to build an other object containing those two objects, and pass it. That works well, but I can't create that kind of object, it's nonsense (even if it works). Of course, the objects aren't as simple as Foo and Bar here, otherwise I would have merge those two. But that's not something I can do. Is it even possible to pass two objects like that to use in a form ? Thanks already. ",1

Why can't I add these default values in my SQLite database in Android?,"So I'm building an alarm application. I want to display a few default alarms when the application is first installed. For example, 3 alarms at 7am, 8am and 9am. Below is my code.getAllAlarms() is called to retrieve the list of alarms to be displayed. On first load up, the database would be empty, so I want to insert some default values if that is the case. This can be seen in the else statement where I add the alarms and then do a recursive call on itself. My understand is that after adding the 3 alarms, I call getAllAlarms again, it should enter the if statement normally. This appears to be the case as can be seen in the debug System.out.println statements. The list of alarms is printed out as expected however, somewhere along the line it appears the method is called again which results in the list being made empty as can be seen in the last debug statements.Can you see where problem is? I've done a file search in the project and I'm not calling the delete method anywhere nor am I calling getAllAlarms apart from inside the method itself and in the ListActivity. The problem must be localized in the getAllAlarms method I think but I can't find it. Is it the recursive call?This is my add method:Debug output:UPDATE::I've tried this to no avail:if (cursor.moveToFirst()) {        do {            Alarm alarm = new Alarm();            alarm.setID(cursor.getInt(0));            alarm.setHour(cursor.getInt(1));            alarm.setMinutes(cursor.getInt(2));            // Adding alarm to list            alarmList.add(alarm);            System.out.println(""inside loop"");            System.out.println(alarmList);However, this works by itself if I remove the if statement to check for the empty list and then I add the check outside the Database and inside the ListActivity. This is not what I want though. I don't want to be handling default value insertion outside the Database class. else    {        System.out.println(""Adding default values..."");        addAlarm(new Alarm(7,0));        addAlarm(new Alarm(8,0));        addAlarm(new Alarm(9,0));        System.out.println(""Finished adding default values..."");    }and inside ListActivity:}",1

Unit test failing due to surefire plugin's forkmode,"There is a test in my code which creates a directory and then creates a file inside it. However, this test fails as the portion of the test that writes the file is not able to find the directory that is created. The only thing that fixes it is to set the surefire plugin to never fork like so:I would interpret this fix to mean that the directory is created in one JVM process and the file is created in another JVM process/thread ? This test failure is isolated to a single machine on which it has started failing only recently. A couple of things that I have tried are :There were numerous JDK versions floating around on the system, so got rid of all except the one that was working on a number of other systems ( 1.6.0_19 ). Tried running the 'mvn test' on that project from an Administrator cmd prompt.Checked that the permissions of the parent directory are fine.Tried checking out the whole project from scratch and doing the same.Checked that the directory where this was happening was excluded from AntiVirus' On-Access-Scanner.None of the above seem to have any effect. The only thing that makes a difference is the  config. I can't figure out why that test suddenly stopped working when there have been absolutely no code changes around it or in the functionality that it's testing.

Using Ant's classpath in Eclipse,"I have an Ant build.xml file that works just fine on the command line: it compiles, builds the JAR, and I am able to execute the main method from the JAR just fine. The build.xml file references several thirdparty libraries that are scattered here and there. When building the JAR, the script doesn't include all the thirdparty libraries into the JAR itself. Instead, it puts their path into the JAR's manifest. This helps to keep my JAR slim and tidy.I'd like to be able to edit and debug my project in Eclipse, but I can't find an easy way to do so. I can have my project use the Ant file to build the project, and that seems to work. However, Eclipse is having trouble finding the thirdparty libaries, and thus Eclipse is having two problems: it shows (in the text editor) lots of compile errors, becauselots of classes are undefined, and  it can't execute the JAR.I can solve both of the above problems by specifying by hand, in two difference places (i.e., the build path via Properties->Java Build Path->Libraries, and the execution classpath via Run Configurations->Classpath), all the third party libraries. But it seems like I shouldn't have to do this manually, since all the third party libraries are already listed in my JAR's manifest. What am I doing wrong?Here's my build.xml file:You can see that I have third-party libraries in several directories (${lib}, ${hive-util}, ${hpdb}, and ${static}). I use these to create a path called dep.runtime. I then include dep.runtime in the manifest when building my jar.

Maven Java API : Standalone Dependency Resolution (i.e. not a Maven plugin),"I've been trying to develop a relatively simple application (used as pre-cursor to a custom build process) which will process some POMs and resolve all the dependencies in advance (transitevely) from a remote repo.I've succesfully been able to extract various properties from the POM (which I'm making use of elsewhere), but the dependency resolution is proving to be rather difficult.I have experimented using various classes from org.apache.maven and also looked into Aether. I've poured over many resources online regarding dependency resolution with org.apache.maven, however they all seem to cover Maven plugins (which hook into the Plexus container with annotations) rather than a standalone application, where I don't [believe I] have access to that container and so cannot use the sorts of objects I need, such as an ArtifactResolver or ArtifactRepositoryFactory.Is there a way to get the Plexus container when not being executed as part of Maven? If so, are there any good resources for explaining this? If not, are there any implmentations of the key classes which don't require the Plexus container?",0
What built-in Java hash function to use for password,I'm working on a school project making a java program including a login/subscribe form.Because it's for school I'm not supposed to include any third-party library like jBcrypt or other strong hashing function.I think about generating one salt per user with a sha256 of java.security.random but I don't know what hashing function to use for the password.I don't want to use only one iteration of a sha256/512 as it's a bit weak and I also don't want to make a for loop with 100 iteration of a sha256/512 as I guess if bcrypt and others exist it''s because iterating sha isn't enough (and also because I know  it's always a bad idea to try reinventing cryptography by yourself).So what built-in hashing function should I use to store my password ?NB. I know that in this case (school project) the login data don't deserve a very good security (and it's also not required by my subject) but I want to do it as good as possible so please don't answer that a md5/sha512 hash would be enough for such a situation.,1

Ensuring UML constraints in Java?,"Say that the design of my application is such that there are two classes: Person and Company. Also suppose I have defined a UML diagram that defines a one-to-many relationship between  Person and Company: every Person object must belong to exactly one Company, and a Company can contain many Persons.What are some best practices for ensuring that this simple constraint always holds, i.e., that there is never a point in time where a Person object is contained in more than one Company? I've thought of three approaches:Have perfect, bug-free code that would never violate any of my constaints. However, being a realist, I know that this is difficult or impossible, especially as the number of constraints grows.Implement an ensureCorrectness() method that manually checks each and every constraint. In this example, it would loop through all Persons, and make sure that exactly one Company contained that Person. If not, it would print an error. I would call this method every so often.Use, e.g., Hibernate to define a database schema and store the data into a database. In the schema, I can define a constraint to match the constrains in my UML diagram. Then, whenever I persists data into the database, Hibernate will check all the constraints and print an error if something's gone wrong.But I can't help wondering if there is another, cleaner way to do this in Java, that doesn't rely on (1) perfection, (2) manual validation, or (3) a relational database. Is there a library or framework that would allow me to specify annotations in the code similar to:@OneToMany(Person, Company)Or perhaps more specifically:@OneToMany(Person, Company.persons)assuming the Company class had a List persons member variable.And if I wanted to ensure that a person's social security number is unique across all Persons, I could say:@Unique(Person.SSN)Does anything like this exist for Java?",0

"Thermostat to DB, OOP Design","I am attempting my first Java project (just started learning it/OOP). I have built a thermostat circuit that I can get the temperature from using a driver, and am now in the process of designing a Java program that interfaces with the thermostat and inserts the data into a mysql DB.I'm attempting to do this properly, and so have come up with a basic UML diagram of my classes/objects and how they interact. I plan on using a database interface class which will extend a database connection class. This database interface will insert into the DB, and the database connection constructor will create the database connection.I will also have a thermostat class which interfaces with the thermostat itself, it will have 2 private variables, temperature and humidity. It will have the method update temp, which will update the private variables. The get temp method will be provide the interface to these private variables.Finally the control class is composed of the thermostat and database interface classes, and will call the methods of both classes to get the temp/humidity data into the database.UML diagram:Do you have any thoughts? I don't know how good this design is. Is the controller interacting with the other classes in the correct way?Thank you for your time.X. ",0

If I manually add the class files into the jar they are found, so this suggests it's not resolving dependencies using the local repository.I assume this is happening because I manually installed the jar file.If a jar is manually installed, will it only resolve the dependencies if they are in the jar and not look outside?The plugin is referenced in the pom like this:",0

Maven exclusion not working,"I am working on a project that has a dependency of JUnit 4.11 and a transitive dependency of JMock 2.6.0-RC2 who in turn has a dependency of JUnit-dep 4.4. This transitive dependency of JUnit-dep is overriding the setting in my local pom for JUnit. By overriding, I mean that when I call a JUnit method, it calls the one from v4.4 as opposed to v4.11. Adding exclusions for JMock and for JUnit-dep had no effect on my resolved dependencies.Note: JUnit and JUnit-dep have separate artifactIds, therefore use of one does not omit the other.Previous Question: JUnit annotation not workingI am attempting to run a test with JUnit's ExpectedException rule yet when I run the test, it appears as though the rule is not running.

How to find all Java method calls and given parameters in a project programmatically?,"I have a multilingual web application that gets all of the translations from a single object, for example lang.getTranslation(""Login"") and the object is responsible for finding the translation in an xml file in the user's language.What I'd like to do is a script / custom static analysis that outputs all the missing translations and translations that are no more used in the application.

Eclipse. Run two different mains when the second reads a static field of the previous,"I have a Java project in eclipse which is divided in two parts; two different main classes that run two different Threads basically. One contains loading, initialization and debug-showing procedures that are quite slow. While, the other manipulates the initialized data. In order to retrieve the information in the second part, the first one ""saves"" all the references inside a static map which contains instances of classes. Does exist a way to run the first part only once, and then compile and run the second part more times? I tried with just set two different console and pressing the run button in different times but the static field of the first class looks not existing when the second runs.I am working now only in the second part, so I need to test and start it many times. I really appreciate an help to save a lot of time wasted in always initialize the same thing.ps : Everything works fine if I run both parts together.thanks in advance Lucathanks to the replay (Multithreader, Stephen C) I am trying to make the question more clear and to ask how to solve it since my solution does not look the best one.....EDIT 1 : The ""first part"" initializes the program and then runs an easy GUI which is periodically update. So as long as it shows up we shouldn’t care about how to manage input and output from the userEDIT 2 : the ""second part"" reads information from the previous and send back strings to the GUI  for debug purposes.EDIT 3 : I do not have specific constrains in the shape of the project, so I can change the structure if there are better solutions. As well as for the way to run it.FARTHER QUESTION 1 : there is a possibility to compile only one part of the project in eclipse while it runs all together? I mean, if two threads are running, can I stop one, re-compile it and run it again in a way that it can see the instances created from the first thread which never stops? Basically I need to refer at the same static variable loaded in memory, if it exists.

Once Zxing has scanned a QR code, the information encoded on it is returned to my app and stored, and then after a short delay Zxing is automatically re-initiated.My current code saves an image every frame whilst Zxing is running, the functionality I would like is to have only the frame on scan be saved. Although Zxing stops saving images in the short window where my app takes over again, Zxing is quickly re-initialized however and I may not have time to manipulate the data. A possible workaround however is quickly renaming the saved file so that Zxing doesn't start overwriting it and manipulation can be performed in the background. Nevertheless, saving an image every frame is a waste of resources and less than preferable. How do I only save an image upon scan?Thanks in advance.Updated to show found instances of multiFormatReader as requested:",1
How to filter Google Play so app only displays to 7in tablets,"I recently released an app that only supports 7-8.9inch screens (600dp width).I thought I had applied the correct tag within the manifest to tell Google play to filter out other devices.In the AndroidManifest.xml I used:supports-screens android:requiresSmallestWidthDp=""600""android:largestWidthLimitDp=""600""however it turns out google play doesn't filter with the tag ""requiresSmallestWidthDp""[http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/supports-screens-element.html](""http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/supports-screens-element.html"")(despite using it here [http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens-distribution.html](""http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens-distribution.html""))How can I filter the app so that the play store will only display the app to compatible (7 - 8.9 in devices.

How to make Weakrefernce in Concurrent HashMap,"In my Program I have a scenario, where Mutiple Thread will operate (put and get) on a single Map. Like Thread a using put a key/value in the map and the same time another thread is retrieving the key/value from the map for the same or different key. Now if I make my map synchronize then it wil be a big performance issue, so I decided to move to ConcurrentHashMap. During this scenario, I have another complexity that after certain period of time(not known to my application) few of the key/value pairs are not needed in my application, so I need to remove the same(Garbage Collection) to free memory. Though my programm doesn't have the idea that which key/values are not needed I thought to use weakrefernce. So, after ceratin period of time if the key(String) is not reachable it will be automatically garbage collected. I know the process to do the same in WeakhashMap but doesn't know the process to do it in ConcurrentHashMap. So, can anyone tell me how to do a weakrefernce in ConcurrentHashMap.

Any way to turn on/off a println in java (verbose mode),"Is there any way in Java that you can make a println appear only when requested, not by default? Basically something similar to using ""-v"" in many programs to give you verbose mode, with information on what is happening.For example let's say I have an if statement in a loop, and a simple println that tells me whether the if statement evaluates to true for each iteration of the loop. Is there any other way to toggle on/off it's visibility other than commenting it out when I don't need it and uncomment it when I do? Then saving it, recompiling it, etc.It would make it a lot easier to see what is going on in my program, but only when I want that much info. As I said, I am basically looking for a way to implement a ""verbose"" mode that shows print statements, without having to comment/uncomment save, recompile, etc. Does Java have anything like this?",0

Better way to locate problems in a running Java application?,"We have a few java applications (jars) running as backend server applications on localhost. These programs are inside a virtual box (RHEL 6.2).After one of the jar's ran for 5 days, it stopped working.

To find out what caused this, we put in some println's and redirected output to a text file using the > operator on the commandline using shellscript.After about 4 or 5 days, we faced a situation where we could see that the jar was still running, but it wasn't outputting anything to the text file or to the database to which the application was supposed to write entries.Perhaps the textfile became too large for the virtual box to handle, but basically we wanted to know this:  How are such runtime problems located in Java?

I've tried setting ""Show Static Variables"" by selecting it from the down-arrow in the Variables window, still no luck.  I've tried right-clicking the variable and selecting ""Watch"" and I get this:I'm calling the DoublingRatio.main() method from my HelloWorld.java class.  Not sure if that makes a difference.  I can view local variables in the HelloWorld.main() method.  I've also tried taking HelloWorld.class out of the loop by setting DoublingRatio as the starting class in the project settings.  That configuration still doesn't work, can't see the local variables in the main() method.How can I watch the variables in DoublingRatio.main()?",0

Jenkins Maven Plugin: Classloading Feature,"Good time!Our team uses Maven. One of the project modules has a plugin (maven-jibx-plugin) that requires (for our use-case) a dependency on a proprietary jar: The problem is when we build the project locally (and even from a command line on the remote machine where jenkins is istalled), everything builds successfully, but when our jenkins instance tries to build it - the build fails with such a message: ""Unable to find class 'class-name-from-the-proprietary-jar'"". This problem occurred loccally before we added the plugin dependency.. Seems like there is some feature of jenkins maven plugin that do no resolve the plugin dependencies or may be there are some well-known feature of the jenkins maven plugin classloading (JiBX loads proprietary classes with such a construct: SchemaRootBase.class.getClassLoader().loadClass(cname) So that specifing the dependency for the plugin should provide a knowledge for it about the required classes)... Can somebody, please, suggest the workaround?UPDATE: it turned out that the jenkins instance's JAVA_HOME variable is set to /usr/java/jdk1.7.0_25, but in my maven-compiler-plugin I have 1.6. Could it be that the problem is in the 1.7 java version?",0

Strip version number from dependency based on group ID in maven,"I have a project that has 3rd party dependencies, as well as dependencies on internal projects. I need to strip the version numbers from the dependent artifacts that are developed in-house.For example: spring-2.5.6.jar should be in the final output as spring-2.5.6.jar but MyInternalProject-1.0.17.jar needs to be changed to MyInternalProject.jar.I can identify the internal dependencies easily enough by their group ID (they are all something like com.mycompany.*). The maven-dependency-plugin has a stripVersion option, but it does not seem to be selective enough.

How to configure ApacheDS Working Directory in Spring config file?,"I have written some unit tests for LDAP authentication using spring security and the embedded ApacheDS server.

Replace Eclipse with Sublime Text 2/3 for java,"Has anyone managed to build out a way to use Sublime Text 2 (or 3) instead of eclipse for their java-based app? We've got java in eclipse (mac), with maven and git support. We don't 'build' in eclipse, per-se.

Upgrade from IBM WSED 5.1.2 to IBM RAD 7.5,"Our group currently uses Websphere Studio Enterprise Developer V. 5.1.2.

Eclipse plugin works when debugging but not when installing,"I wrote an Eclipse plugin that presents a right click menu option on any file or folder (for example, in navigator view). For each file selected (and for each file inside of a selected directory), the plugin computes and displays the MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512 hash of the file. The plugin works perfectly when I debug while developing.If I make the site using site.xml, put it on my server, and then install to Eclipse (it installs just fine), I see the menu. I can compute and display the hash for a selected file, but it just won't work for a selected folder. Absolutely nothing has changed in the code; it always works in debug mode, and it never works when I install it.My question is this: how can I debug this? At first, I thought Eclipse's workspace/.metadata/.log file would offer some clue, but no error is output. I even went so far as to try adding some code in that writes a file to the desktop, but that file never gets created. Does anyone have any clue what is going on or how I should go about fixing this? I've never had such a hard time debugging before!For reference, [https://github.com/gfairchild/eclipse-hasher](""https://github.com/gfairchild/eclipse-hasher"") is the project. All source code is viewable there (it can be imported as an Eclipse project).The answer ultimately involved 2 things:I wasn't including the lib directory during the build process. The dependency I use (Apache Commons Codec) wasn't included, so of course it wouldn't run.During the testing process, I had tried manually putting a build of Hasher into eclipse/plugins. I incorrectly assumed that if I uninstalled Hasher through the Eclipse interface, this file would be removed. It wasn't. So for the last month, I've had a stale version of Hasher being loaded into Eclipse. That's incredibly frustrating. Oh, well. Lesson learned.Thanks very much to everyone that offered help!",0

Pros and Cons of implementing Properties in Java,"In C# there exists a type of member that is called a Property. This allows you to easily and simply define a private field and provide simple or complex getters and setters while saving space by not having to define whole methods.

Generating a row within a cross product given an integer,"I've got a problem I'm struggling with a bit. Given an arbitrary number of arrays and an integer called 'specificity', I need to generate the row representing that point within the cross product of the arrays. Arrays are always a length of at least 2 and the last value of each array is always null. No other elements are ever null except for the last in each array. For example, given the arrays {1, 2, null} and {A, B, null}, the cross product would effectively be:0: 1 A 1: 1 B 2: 1 null 3: 2 A 4: 2 B 5: 2 null 6: null A 7: null B 8: null null  So, given 'specificity' 4 for example with the two arrays listed above, it should return back the array {2, B}. That's the easy part. I've completed this particular case in the code section below. However, consider the case where combinations without nulls take precedence. The ordering would now be:0: 1 A 1: 1 B 2: 2 A 3: 2 B 4: 1 null 5: 2 null 6: null A 7: null B 8: null null  Here's the algorithm I've implemented so far. The first case above is handled just fine, but I don't know what to do for the second case. Any thoughts on what would go into the ""else"" clause?",0

Implementing new InetAddress types in Java,"today it's about the InetAddress class of java. There are 2 default implementations (actually 3 if you take InetAddressImpl in count): Inet4Address for representing IPv4 addresses and Inet6Address for representing IPv6 Addresses.Now there are several tunneling protocols. Because I want the software to be type safe, I thought about implementing them as subclasses of InetAddress (InetTeredoAddress or Inet6to4Address for example). The best solution would be to inherit from Inet6Address but because it is final, this option is dropped. The next idea is to create subclasses of InetAddress and delegate every method to it's Inet6Address pendant:This, again, fails because its constructors are only visible in java.net.* . Just for fun, I tried to create a package called java.net and placed all classes inside. This way I was able to compile but when starting the program, (surprise surprise) the following error occurredWhat would be the best way to implement the protocols? Or is a Helper class the only solution?Thanks in advanceZota",1

Issue with message expressions in hibernate validator,"I'm working on a project and I've been using Hibernate Validator for a while.

Hence, I conclude that it is allowed to write a message like this:and expect that a message literal whose key is either x.y.z.message or x.y.w.message be the result, where x.y.z.message and x.y.w.message are assumed to be valid and already defined message keys in a properly bootstrapped resource bundle.To clarify things out, I've written a test case using TestNG and ran it against hibernate-validator-5.0.1.Final and hibernate-validator-5.1.0-Alpha. As is pointed out in test comments, the results obtained by these releases vary themselves on this specific issue which hints me towards an implementation bug. I first thought this might have to do with [[HV-798]](""https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HV-798"") but it seems deeper.Here is the test case:In this test Entity.getMessage3() demonstrates the issue which is caught by last part of the test.

Software design and cyclic Maven dependencies,"I have an issue in my application design.

So E there is a Maven dependency E->V. Now I want to integrate E into V, because users should be able to start the editor out of the viewer. That means I also have a Maven dependency V->E which causes a dependency cycle. I tried different scope values but was not able to break the cycle. How can I achieve this?The V project is a very monolithic and not well-structured bunch of code and I don't want to divide it.

Since the code of onExit()would vary from 3 classes, it should be an abstract method &amp; onCrushing()would be same fo all classes, so it would be an concrete method tHE MAIN WINdow should use singleton design to ensure user only create one instance of main. Use the facade design to save the trouble of implementing 3 interfaces to three classesMy question is I don't really understand facade design, so I am not sure if it can be applied in this case.

How to 'jump' to a method in Java without linking back to where it was called from?,"I call a method from my main class, and when a particular condition is met, I have that method call itself with updated parameters. When I have the method call itself, I don't need it to come back to where it was called from. In other words, there's no need to have a ""stack"" of method calls - each method call can take the place of the previous method's call on the stack.To make my point clearer, when using MIPS assembly language, we use jump (j) and jump-and-link (jal). I want my method call to be like a jump and not worry about coming back to its caller. I figure this might save some time/improve performance.This is the relevant section of my code: This conditional block is in my parse method and I am calling parse from itself but I don't want it to come back to the caller. Would really appreciate any ideas on how to do this. ",1

"How to best convert Map<String,Foo> to Map<MyEnum,Foo> in a wrapper","Update, adding the question from the comments:   what's the best way to get the Map into Map where  Foo is an Enum. it just seems awfully complicated when, conceptually,  not a complex idea.This code functions, it's part of a simple [MUD client](""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mud_client"").  The basic idea is that Monitor holds data (hit points, etc) which will be displayed to the user during game play, perhaps in a secondary JPanel; something along those lines.  The possible values for this report are in the Attribs as an Enum.Before going too far down that path, when I look at the Monitor class and what it takes to create a single instance it seems more than a little verbose.If I move convertToEnumEntry out of Monitor then the class won't work.  So, the class can't get smaller, I don't think.  Is there a pattern I could use (or use better)?Everything in this class rests on the assumption  that if convertToEnumEntry returns a null reference to a Map.Entry to then get the one, specific String which doesn't fit in Attribs:enemy = stringEntry.getKey();Unlike the other keys, the enemy can be any String.  The other keys are limited to the Enum values of Attribs (attributes).It's tempting to either cram everything into either one class to parse and build the Map, or put everything into Monitor.  Currently, RegexMapBuilder is a sort of middle ground, because it does most of the hard work, but doesn't quite build a complete Monitor on its own:For brevity, I omitted the Enum, but Attribs is just a list of a few attributes which this report prints.  The only tricky part is that there's one value which isn't really an Enum type.",1

Difference between dependency and composition?,"[Definitions taken from here](""http://javapapers.com/oops/association-aggregation-composition-abstraction-generalization-realization-dependency/"")Dependency  Change in structure or behaviour of a class affects the other related  class, then there is a dependency between those two classes.

In a more specific  manner, a restricted aggregation is called composition. When an object  contains the other object, if the contained object cannot exist  without the existence of container object, then it is called  composition.Concrete examples in Java from [here](""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11881552/implementation-difference-between-aggregation-and-composition-in-java/12431359#12431359"">here)DependencyComposition",0

i need to program this code with arraylist,anything i do seems to break down my code into unusable rubbish. Note that it is also a mess... but at least it does work almost properly.Here are some details:it's sort of a particle system but with images. koffer stands for bag and it has to be a sort of eplosion of rotating bags that get slightly bigger or smaller for the depth effect and they fade away in time and after leaving the screen it should be deleted.For now i got half of the bags that explode to turn random ways and half of the bags don't do that. They all fade but don't get deleted after leaving the screen. there is no slight resize yet. But most of all i have to use an arraylist() and don't know how to implement that. here is my code:Main Class BagEplode:and i got the Class Ball:Thanx for helping me in advance.

Printing out the least occurring elements in an array,"OK, so I found this question from a few days ago but it's on hold and it won't let me post anything on it.***Note: The values or order in the array are completely random.

If one of the least occurring elements isn't at the BEGINNING of the array then this does not work. This is because the maxCount will be equal to array.length and the results array will ALWAYS take the first element in the code written below.What ways are there to combat this, using simple java such as below? No hash-maps and whatnot. I've been thinking about it for a while but can't really come up with anything. Maybe using a double array to store the count of a certain number? How would you solve this?

Everything works fine the first run through, but trying to run through it again, it freezes the whole thing, forcing me to terminate it via the debugger or task manager.  I know I'm doing something wrong, I'm just not sure what, due to my limited experience with Java.Below is the code I use to setup my window and place it in the lower-right corner above the taskbar:And below is the code I've setup to make it pulse to draw the user's attention:Anyway, like I mentioned, it works fine for the first use, but as soon as you close the window via the right-click then attempt to re-run it later (whether by calling the startPulsing() method or by completely reinitializing the whole class with a new JWindow by calling alertWindow() again), the whole program freezes.  Any ideas why this is?Like I said, I'm still a bit of a newbie to Java, so if you see anything else I'm doing wrong/inefficiently, as well, feel free to point it out so I can do it correctly.Edit:I'm starting to think the issue is with JWindows, now.  I setup some other code for a different method of displaying the alert and, while it doesn't freeze this time, it doesn't work as intended, either.Just like the pulsing window issue, it works as intended the first time, then breaks on subsequent uses.  In this case, the only thing that breaks is the scrollOn() command.  It scrolls on while invisible, then becomes visible once it reaches its destination.  The console output of the position clearly shows that it's moving, but you can't see it until it stops moving.",1
Configure Eclipse build path and javadoc Google+,"What's the right way to configure an Eclipse Java project (NOT Android!!! it's going to be a CLI application), based on [Java Quick Start app](""https://developers.google.com/+/quickstart/java""), to add the libraries and documentation to its build path?First of all, I created a new project. Then, I moved the source from the original directory (from Google) to my project's src. After this, I copied the ""lib"" directory to the root of my project and refreshed.I did ""configure build path"" but:1) adding lib as ""Class folder"" doesn't take the import errors out2) adding all the files (via Cmd-A on ""Add External JARs..."") makes the project runnable but the documentation isn't loaded (mouse-over method does not show the javadoc for it).",0

Continue processing after AsyncContext.complete(),"First of all I want to say that English is not my first language, so excuse me if I make some obvious mistakes or something is not clear enough. The question:Recently I've been moved to a new project where we are developing a Java EE application that provides some REST services via Jersey+Hibernate. Prior to this I only had experience with Java SE, but there was someone experienced already laying the foundations so I had my time to learn from his code and using Google and SO a lot. The thing is, among those REST services there is one that can take a lot of time to complete, and the team decided to implement it in a non-blocking way. We will define two services: with the first one the client sends the data to process, then we return an acknowledgement and start the processing while the client can continue with other things; and the second one allows the client to check later if their job is done.While investigating how to implement this the best way possible, my aforementioned colleague discovered the AsyncServlet feature of Servlets 3.0, and had a proof of concept implemented before I arrived, which later he evolved into a locally working (but very dirty) version of the service. He says he had to drop Jersey for this, since Servlets 3.0 weren't compatible with the version of Jersey we work with, and finally decided to implemented a plain servlet.At the end, he got something like this (I don't have the code right now since I'm at home and writing by memory, but I'll try to write it as clear as possible and try to fix any big mistakes tomorrow morning):A servlet which handles the new requests in doPost() and the checking in doGet():And a worker thread that implements Runnable and the first thing it does is to call ctx.complete() on the AsyncContext that was sent to him in the constructor. My colleague  reasoning is, if the worker notifies the parent right away he has completed, the parent can commit the response back to the client and then start his own processing with the other data passed to him in the constructor:Well, as I said this works on his local test server (Tomcat 7), but a few days ago I was asked to clean his code and when ran on my machine which has a JBoss EAP 6.1, I found that it doesn't work as expected, since the parent servlet does not commit the response until the worker dies (we have different servers because the production machines are new and the higher ups haven't decided which server to install yet and changed their minds a bunch of times, bureaucracy...)I did a bunch of tries and I'm pretty sure I didn't remove any key element of the async processing while cleaning, as my version compiles and runs fine. At the end I got a test case where the worker just sleeps 10 seconds, then writes at the log; in Tomcat the response reaches the client almost instantly then at 10s the log is written; while in JBoss the client has to wait the full 10s to receive the response.Then, I started investigating the AsyncServlet feature, and I think he got the idea the wrong way, this feature seems to be directed to asynchronous internal processing and not as we want to use it, but I can't understand why it does work on his Tomcat. From the javadocs of the complete() method I understand the JBoss behavior is the correct one:  If this method is called before the container-initiated dispatch that called startAsync has returned to the container, then the call will not take effect (and any invocations of AsyncListener#onComplete(AsyncEvent) will be delayed) until after the container-initiated dispatch has returned to the container.So, my question is if the AsyncServlet features are intended for our use case, and, if not, if there are any other cleaner ways to get our desired behavior (bonus points if they are compatible with Jersey). I'm thinking on just spawning a thread and not using the asyncontext at all, but sounds quite risky...Thanks and sorry for the wall of text",1

In need of critique for UML overview of project structure,"Note: I couldn't get formatting to work inside a code block for italics and things, so there is some makeshift markup to attempt to convey the meaning. Also the html escape character for a filled diamond would not work. Hopefully it still makes senseI have a project in my Java class where I need to create a GUI program that basically models a small inventory database. The main focus is to create it in an object oriented manner. So basically before getting started I've mapped out a simplified UML which just specifies the classes, composition and inheritance without defining variables or methods - implementing those will be easy but I want to make sure I have a solid heirarchial structure of good object oriented design before I start adding in the details. So if you could please take the time to look over my project structure and let me know if there's anything I should change, omit or add. The project will basically be a makeshift video game store application that simply reads and writes records to a text file, and the administrator managing the database should have a graphical interface to navigate, add, delete, and edit records. I will spruce it up nicely with some great functionality, but for right now, I'm only focused on making sure my structure is good. I'm still a little new to UML modelling, so I hope I've used conventions properly, and where text-based UML caused conventions to be impossible to follow, I hope the meaning is still clear with ""a"" and ""c"" inside diamonds to indicate aggregation or composition, and a capital ""A"" to indicate an abstract class (italics wouldn't show inside code markdown)Again, I'm looking only for guidance on the hierarchy, OOP design, composition etc. of my program structure. i.e. should this be abstract, should that be an interface, should I add more/less levels of subclassing, etc. I'm confident about churning out the code reliably, but my grasp and command of OOP design principles is still not good enough.Thanks in advance for your help!",0

building dependencies in a jar type maven project,"I have a maven project with package type jar which has some dependencies which will be packed in the resulting jar file when building the project. Some of those dependencies are my own projects which I'd like to automatically re-build when I build the current project. How can this be achieved? I currently only found the  section which can only be used with package type pom, so this seems to be out of the question. Any ideas on this problem? Here a short example of the packages current pom:UPDATE:To elaborate on the development problem I try to solve:Imagine you have both projects open in your IDE (I use netbeans). You are debugging myproject2 to track down some bug. You navigate by jumping through the code by klicking on Class names or by following the steps in the debugger. This may often lead to changes in myproject1 without you even noticing it. In result the you would rebuild myproject2 (which you are debugging) without myproject1 being rebuild automatically. The error still happens and you may be clueless why this happens and search and search for another bug until you realize you didn't rebuild myproject1 before. You would then have to rebuild myproject1 afterwards myproject2 and then would have the correct behaviour (or the next bug). This happens quite often at work.The same can happen with a separate multi-project POM which essentially is another project which will/can be forgotten when working on the code in the IDE.",0

Would Java indexOf (brute force method) be more practical for me or some other substring algorithm?,"I'm looking at finding very short substrings (pattern, needle) in many short lines of text (haystack). However, I'm not quite sure which method to use outside the naive, brute force method. Background: I'm doing a side project for fun where I receive text messaging chat logs of multiple users (anywhere from 2000-15000 lines of text and 2-50 users), and I want to find all the various pattern matches in the chat logs based on predetermined words that I've come up with. So far I have about 1600 patterns that I'm looking for, but I may look for more. So for example, I want to find the number of food related words that are used in an average text message log such as ""hamburger"", ""pizza"", ""coke"", ""lunch"", ""dinner"", ""restaurant"", ""McDonalds"". While I gave out English examples, I will actually be using Korean for my program. Each of these designated words will have their own respective score, which I put in a hashmap as key and value separately. I then show the top scorers for food related words as well as the most frequent words used by those users for food words.My current method is to eliminate each line of text by whitespaces, and process each individual word from the haystack by using contains method (which uses the indexOf method and the naive substring search algorithm) of the haystack contains the pattern.To give an example, with 17 users in chat, 13000 lines of text, and the 1600 patterns, I've found that this whole program took 12-13 seconds with this method. And on the Android app that I'm developing, it took 2 minutes and 30 seconds to process, which is far too slow.Originally, I tried to use a hash map and to merely get the pattern instead of searching for it in the ArrayList, but I then realized that is...[for what I am trying to do with a substring.I've looked around through Stackoverflow and found a lot of helpful and related questions, such as these two:1](""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10529915/hash-table-and-substring-matching"">not) and [I initially thought then that the naive method would of course be the worst type of algorithm for my case, but having found this question](""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1765579/fast-algorithm-for-searching-for-substrings-in-a-string?rq=1"">2.), I've realized that my case (short pattern, short text), might actually be more effective with the naive method. But I wanted to know if there was something that I was neglecting completely.Here is a [snippet of my code](""http://pastebin.com/EhK1mxkU"") though if anyone wants to see my issue more concretely. While I removed large parts of the code to simplify it, the primary method that I use to actually match substrings is there in the method matchWords().I know that's really ugly and bad code (5 for loops...), so if there are any suggestions for that, I'm happy to hear it as well.So to clean it up:lines of text from chat logs (2000-10,000+), haystack1600+ patterns, needle(s)mostly using Korean characters, although some English is includedBrute force naive method is simply too slow, but debating whether there are other alternatives and even if there are, whether they are practical given the nature of short patterns and text.I just want some input on my thought process, and possibly some general advice. But additionally, I would like some specific suggestion for a particular algorithm or method if that is possible.",0
Android App Checkbox lag when updating,"I am somewhat new to Android app development and I have made a few basic apps.

Beginner programming exercises (Java): recursively counting instances of substring in string (.equals()?),"I am working through a set of online exercises found at Codingbat.com for my own amusement.

I tried to adapt my previous method, using substring() instead of charAt():However, this always returns 0. It looks like the testing conditionis never met, but I can't work out why. Hope someone can help!EDIT :As Steve and JustinKSU pointed out, I was returning a single character substring. I thought that the index numbers in the substring() method referred to the index of characters as if they were stored in an array (where 0 would be first character, 1 second etc.) It looks like a better way to think about it is that the substring() indexes represent the count of character separators in the string, starting with a separator preceding the first character, (such that substring(0, 1) encapsulates the first character).",1

"Can Eclipse be configured to use ""favorites"" without static imports?","I’d like to configure Eclipse with some “favorite” static-method collections, but without using static imports.For example, if I add com.google.common.collect.Lists the list in Window » Preferences » Java » Editor » Content Assist » Favorites, I can type “newA”, press Ctrl-Space, and pick the Lists.newArrayList method from that list. But:1) If “static imports” is enabled in Preferences » Java » Editor » Content Assist, the result is that Eclipse adds a static import for com.google.common.collect.Lists.newArrayList and auto-completes my code to newArrayList(...).2) If “static imports” is disabled, then:2.a) If the class with the static method is not imported, it adds an import for the class, and auto-completes to Lists.newArrayList(...), which is exactly what I want. However,2.b) If the class with the static method is already imported, then it just auto-completes to newArrayList(...), which of course doesn’t compile.My question is: Is there a way to configure Eclipse so that (2.b) behaves like (2.a) all the time?

How to include resources AND dependencies in JAR?,"I have a Java project which depends on an external library and contains a resource called template.pdf. The library lives in a folder outside my workspace and is referenced by the project using Project -> Properties -> Build Path -> Libraries -> Add External Jar. The resource file currently resides in the bin/ folder in my workspace so that I can access it using PDFProject.class.getResourceAsStream(""/template.pdf""), which works both inside Eclipse and in the JAR file, assuming that I export the JAR file using method 1 below.My goal is to be able to export the project to a JAR which includes both the resource and the dependencies, while also being able to run the code from inside both Eclipse and the JAR without changing the code used for accessing the resource or having to maintain multiple copies of any of the files. So far I have tried:Exporting using Export -> JAR file with the Export all output folders for checked projects box ticked. This exports the JAR with the resource file included and allows the resource to be accessed using the same path (""/template.pdf"") from both Eclipse and the JAR, but does not offer an option to package the dependencies inside the JAR.Exporting using Export -> Runnable JAR file with the [Extract/Package] required libraries into generated JAR option selected. This exports the jar with the dependencies inside, but leaves out the resource file.Moving the resource file into the project's src/ directory, then exporting using method 2 above. This correctly packages both the resource and dependencies into the JAR, but the code will not run in Eclipse without modification since ""/template.pdf"" is no longer on the class-path.I realize that I could manually place the resource into the JAR after exporting, or keep a copy of the resource file in both bin/ and src/, or copy the library's source into my project directly, but these solutions seem inefficient as a general practice. Most of my searching seems to indicate that build tools like Ant or Maven might provide an acceptable solution, but I would prefer, if possible, to avoid tackling that learning curve at this time. Is there a way to create the JAR file as specified above using only the basic Eclipse export options and folder hierarchy?EDIT: Thorbjørn Ravn Andersen's comment below did help me uncover a large mistake on my part, regarding how I was adding the resource file to the project. Rather than using the Import feature of Eclipse, I was manually copying the file to the source folder through the OS, then using Refresh from the right-click menu to update the Package Explorer in Eclipse. I assumed, wrongly, that this would do any necessary updating of the project, but I also needed to clean the project afterwards to cause the file to be reflected in the output folder (or just use the Import feature to add the file in the first place).This essentially solves my problem by allowing me to only have to maintain the copy of the resource file which lives in the source folder, but it does result in having multiple copies of the file on disk. For my small project, this is not a problem. For large projects with many resource files, however, this could result in a lot of disk usage for duplicate files. Surely there must be a way to achieve a similar result without the duplication?",0

Periodically saving a HashMap read out of a file,"Alright everyone, I'm still in the process of self-teaching about writing server-side apps, and I'm working on a rough draft for an iOS app I have planned. What I intend to do is have the app submit and request values to and from basically what amounts to be a HashMapof different keys and values, the exact behavior of which isn't necessary to explain.Obviously, to maintain the stored server data across running instances of the app (i.e. restarts, adding more machines, etc.), I intend to use a FileWriter to save the HashMap to a file. Idea being, when the server application is first run, it pulls the saved HashMap into a instance for ""working storage"".Do any of you have ideas on how to implement a setup that would periodically (every 1 to 10 seconds, suppose) save the file to make the ""working example"" and file synchronized (to prevent against loss of data due to power outage, program failure, act of God, etc.).I looked up the reference for FileWriter and couldn't see anything listed. I'd definitely prefer to use a method more sophisticated than overwriting, destroying and reopening a file every second. Word to the wary - I'm a bit new to Java.

How can I write code to hint to the JVM to use vector operations?,"Somewhat related question, and a year old: Do any JVM&#39;s JIT compilers generate code that uses vectorized floating point instructions?Preface: I am trying to do this in pure java (no JNI to C++, no GPGPU work, etc...).  I have profiled and the bulk of the processing time is coming from the math operations in this method (which is probably 95% floating point math and 5% integer math).  I've already reduced all Math.xxx() calls to an approximation that's good enough so most of the math is now floating point multiplies with a few adds.I have some code that deals with audio processing.  I've been making tweaks and have already come across great gains.  Now I'm looking into manual loop unrolling to see if there's any benefit (at least with a manual unroll of 2, I am seeing approximately a 25% improvement).  While trying my hand at a manual unroll of 4 (which is starting to get very complicated since I am unrolling both loops of a nested loop) I am wondering if there's anything I can do to hint to the jvm that at runtime it can use vector operations (e.g. SSE2, AVX, etc...).  Each sample of the audio can be calculated completely independently of other samples, which is why I've been able to see a 25% improvement already (reducing the amount of dependencies on floating point calculations).For example, I have 4 floats, one for each of the 4 unrolls of the loop to hold a partially computed value.  Does how I declare and use these floats matter?  If I make it a float[4] does that hint to the jvm that they are unrelated to each other vs having float,float,float,float or even a class of 4 public floats?  Is there something I can do without meaning to that will kill my chance at code being vectorized?I've come across articles online about writing code ""normally"" because the compiler/jvm knows the common patterns and how to optimize them and deviating from the patterns can mean less optimization. At least in this case however, I wouldn't have expected unrolling the loops by 2 to have improved performance by as much as it did so I'm wondering if there's anything else I can do (or at least not do) to help my chances.  I know that the compiler/jvm are only going to get better so I also want to be wary of doing things that will hurt me in the future.Edit for the curious: unrolling by 4 increased performance by another ~25% over unrolling by 2, so I really think vector operations would help in my case if the jvm supported it (or perhaps already is using them).Thanks!",1

How to use the same logger in multiple java projects,"I am looking for a solution to the following system setup.We have a Java NetBeans project that handle the Oracle database with all the entities and the required functionality for a database layer (we cannot replace it with hibernate).

"""code formatting"" commits into svn","This question comes from previous experiences with svn.We had a problem where our code was badly formatted, mainly because of the increase in developers at the time who did not adhere to our formatting guide for various reasons. So there was discrepancies in code formatting for quite a bit of time. Additionally the codebase was quite old as well, so it was probably going on for years.Anyway, there was a suggestion to format all touched classes in new features into our agreed standard code formatting style. Other developers were against this mainly because:You can't use an annotation style view of the code, so you can't see what features a particular line of code is related to.In the end, we ended up rejecting this idea and only did formatting for newly introduced class files. For new code in existing classes, we only ensured that the lines that were edited were indented correctly. We are mostly eclipse users, but I think that this feature is available in other ide's as well (just checked online for netbeans and intellij).For an additional bit of context, the codebase in question was fairly mature and there was a fair balance between support work and new feature work. Sometimes new features were split into phases, so this is also something to consider.So the question(s) are:Was this the correct approach? Is it reasonable to reject ""code formatting commits"" just to preserve an annotated view of the code?Are there better ways of doing this? My opinion here is that maybe there should have been a commit hook that does automatic formatting, not sure if something like this is exists or is even valid though?",0
"Maven: Is it possible to upload a set of 3rd party jars to repository, which can then be referenced as a single dependency?","We are using an internal Nexus Repository for third party jars which are dependencies in our applications.I am starting a new project, and have a set of 4 third party jar files which I want to upload to Nexus, and then reference, ideally, as a single dependency (i.e. artifactId/version) from my project pom.xml. These jars are always given together, never versioned separately, so having a separate artifactId/version combination for each jar is not useful.  Is it possible to upload all the jars into a single artifact/version folder in Nexus, and then to reference them as a single dependency in my Maven project?",0
creating arrays on-demand in java,I consider myself an intermediate Java programmer having been at it for a year and a half and having some experience in other languages. However I have run into an issue that I feel I need an experts help on.As I understand it arrays when created by java exist somewhat outside of where they were created i.e. if you create an array called s in one class and another called s in a second class then try to use both those classes as part of a program you will run into problems with them overwriting each other.However this brings me to an interesting dilemma. What if one wanted to create a unique array on-demand for an infinite number of sets of user input. i.e. is it possible to have the user enter a string value for use as the array name or have a generic value that then gets a number or letter appended to it. This is more a theoretical issue (there being other ways to accomplish the same thing) but any insight would be greatly appreciated.,0

How can I set a WebSphere classloader policy to PARENT_LAST for an app created in Eclipse?,"Our company is currently using RAD to develop our Java apps, but we're looking to move to Eclipse with the WebSphere Developer Tools. The pilot for our transition is going pretty well, except we're running into a classloader policy issue for new applications that are originally created in Eclipse, not RAD. Our projects that were originally created by RAD are deployed with the correct classloader policy (PARENT_LAST) when published via Eclipse because we originally used the Deployment Descriptor Editor in RAD which set the proper classloader policy in /src/main/application/META-INF/ibmconfig/cells/defaultCell/applications/defaultApp/deployments/defaultApp/deployment.xml. But now with Eclipse &amp; WebSphere Developer Tools, we no longer have the nice Deployment Descriptor Editor UI to create or modify this file for us (apparently it's not included with the WDT plugin).So, my question then is what is the best way to go about setting this classloader policy? We still need some new apps to have the classloader policy of PARENT_LAST set when we deploy them to our local servers. Our team has though about this a bit and we can see 4 options at the moment.Open the Admin Console after every publish and change it. This would be a huge pain, and is pretty much not even a real option.Change the server profile setting to use a PARENT_LAST classloader policy for all apps. This however is not the case for all the apps at our company, and would not work for all groups.Run a jython script after every publish to set the classloader policy. This is slightly better than option 1, but not by much.Manually create a deployment.xml file in the same location as the other apps created by RAD with the same structure as the deployment.xml files created by RAD, and modify it as necessary for each app.Option 4 seems to be the best of the bunch, but it's still a manual process and somewhat error prone. Even if most of our developers can grok this approach for new apps, it would be most ideal if this were a simple one button click type process.So given the fact that IBM has omitted the Deployment Descriptor Editor from the WDT plugin it would seem as if option 4 is our only hope, but I'll ask once more, is there any other better way to set a WebSphere classloader policy to PARENT_LAST for an app when that app is created in Eclipse?

Eclipse formatter alignment of comments in switch statement,"I've been experimenting with the code formatter in Eclipse 4.3.2 and have everything set up pretty much the way I want it.

But that's not what I want, and I can't seem to figure out how to make Eclipse leave these comments alone.  I could use the @formatter:off tag to disable formatting of this section entirely, but that's not ideal because I still do want the formatter to run on this code.

Merge SWT images,"I need to merge/combine two SWT images in Java.  Unfortunately I am having issue with the result image coloring, and the result image does not have transparency like the original two images.  I am not an image expert, but I think the PaletteData of the result ImageData somehow affects the coloring for copied pixels of copied second image and the transparency.Changing  SourceData1.palette to  SourceData2.palette would affects coloring for the copied pixels of first image.  The full code can be found in : [https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=153863](""https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=153863"")I tried to change  the PaletteData for the targetData before coping the pixels of thesecond image, but that did not work also.

Gradle: Hot deploy changes to a dependency,"I have an environment where I have a java(spring mvc) webapp being developed by an n-member team on intellij with gradle as the build agent. This project has a dependency that is also being developed by the same team. The dependency is published to a repository from where it is read by the spring mvc app. What happens is that everytime there is a change to the dependency code, the spring app code has to be refreshed to include the latest version of the dependency code. So, the question is that is there a way to do a code swap at runtime in the dependency code and have it take affect in a debug session, pretty much like what JRebel does except that it needs to do it in the dependency code.Any views on this would be highly appreciated.P.S- I tagged gradle and jrebel because there might be a way to achieve this via this tech stack.",0

What is the best way to use a core-java libraries (such as javax.*) that aren't in Android,"I have several JAR libs are needed to be added to the Android projects. The JARs are: But when I build the project I got this message: [2014-06-23 09:55:11 - HolidaysApp] Dx trouble processing ""javax/xml/namespace/QName.class"":Ill-advised or mistaken usage of a core class (java.* or javax.*)when not building a core library.This is often due to inadvertently including a core library filein your application's project, when using an IDE (such asEclipse). If you are sure you're not intentionally defining acore class, then this is the most likely explanation of what'sgoing on.However, you might actually be trying to define a class in a corenamespace, the source of which you may have taken, for example,from a non-Android virtual machine project. This will mostassuredly not work. At a minimum, it jeopardizes thecompatibility of your app with future versions of the platform.It is also often of questionable legality.If you really intend to build a core library -- which is onlyappropriate as part of creating a full virtual machinedistribution, as opposed to compiling an application -- then usethe ""--core-library"" option to suppress this error message.If you go ahead and use ""--core-library"" but are in factbuilding an application, then be forewarned that your applicationwill still fail to build or run, at some point. Please beprepared for angry customers who find, for example, that yourapplication ceases to function once they upgrade their operatingsystem. You will be to blame for this problem.If you are legitimately using some code that happens to be in acore package, then the easiest safe alternative you have is torepackage that code. That is, move the classes in question intoyour own package namespace. This means that they will never be inconflict with core system classes. JarJar is a tool that may helpyou in this endeavor. If you find that you cannot do this, thenthat is an indication that the path you are on will ultimatelylead to pain, suffering, grief, and lamentation.[2014-06-23 09:55:11 - HolidaysApp] Dx 1 error; aborting[2014-06-23 09:55:11 - HolidaysApp] Conversion to Dalvik format failed with error 1Could you help me to figure out the problem ?",0

facebooksdk.jar missing from Android Dependencies library,"I'm trying to create my first Android app using Facebook SDK.

Reverting to generated version!""  I've seen the second error before and gotten it to go away by deleting R.java and having it be rebuilt and then cleaning my projects, but that doesn't work now.Looking in my libraries folder for the project it looks like the problem is that my Android Dependencies library is missing the facebooksdk.jar from its bin folder.

I downloaded another facebook-sdk.jar and added it as an external jar to my project but that doesn't seem to help.

Read a file in Java in the same folder of the runtime jar,"I have a Maven Java application which accesses an XML configuration file. This configuration file should be placed in the same folder of the application jar so that any configuration would easily ""follow"" the application.I use the following piece of code to get the jar's absolute pathRunning it in debug mode returns the following pathSo the jar is run (in debug mode) from the target/classes folder thus the XML config file should be placed in that folder.The problem is that whenever I rebuild the project the target folder gets overwritten and the config file deleted.Is there any way to solve this problem, which affects only the development phase?I was thinking about telling Maven to not delete the config file in some way, but I don't know how.Thank you in advanceBest regards,Giulio",0

How to rebuild Android app in release mode with another package name by command line interface?,"Hello im making an generic app that is configurable by xmls and files on res. Im trying to make differents apks from the same source of code. The problem is that im triying to do this by command line interface and i still dont find a way to change the package name and then build it in release mode. I created my custom build.xml ant file and I tryed this solution,it generates 2 apks: MainActivity-debug.apk and MainActivity-debug-unaligned.apk but didnt work for me since the apk just built on debug mode and didnt even ran on emulator throwing [ INSTALL_FAILED_INVALID_APK].So is there a way of doing this?

Getting ClassCastException for xerces class when importing Ant build script,"(I just asked this in the Gradle forum, but I concluded that SO just works better.)I'm looking at modifying an existing Gradle build script.

How to manage dependencies when developing OSGI bundle in Netbeans and Karaf?,"I'm struggling to wrap my head around developing OSGI bundles to publish to Karaf.  I'm using Netbeans 7.4 and the Create Maven OSGI bundle when creating a new project.  I think what I'm wrestling with is dealing with dependencies between different projects and working with them in Netbeans and then publishing to Karaf.  What I'm trying to do is set up a REST web service; I found [this tutorial](""http://www.liquid-reality.de/display/liquid/2011/12/22/Karaf+Tutorial+Part+4+-+CXF+Services+in+OSGi"") to be a good starting point in getting something basic up and running.  So I started setting up a parent project with sub projects (all of these are from the Maven OSGI Bundle template).  But after I started deploying bundles to my Karaf instance I started wrestling with the ""missing requirement"" errors within Karaf.  I'd start trying to list each dependency in  or  but it seems like I just keep going farther down and always getting new ""missing requirement"" messages listing yet another dependency.  I then started trying the maven copy-dependencies plugin to export whatever dependencies are used in my project and copying whatever comes out into the Karaf deploy folder, too.  That worked for the most part but I'm wrestling with what I think are downstream dependencies of a 3rd party jar, but that's probably a separate question anyway.So, what I'd like to know is how should I be developing a coherent ""application"" with this setup?  I understand I should separate everything into standalone bundles; i.e., I'll have my REST interface as one, the implementation as another, business logic as another.  As a maven project, if I have a dependency for datetime handling or string utilities, maven will handle resolving all of those.  But these dependencies won't automatically be included in my OSGI bundle, is that the case? What is the workflow to make sure that everything my project depends on is available to the bundles in Karaf?  What about my projects that have other projects as dependencies, i.e., an interface implementation? I would include that project as a dependency so it will compile, but how do I make sure that that dependency is met after it is published?",0

problems when Improve Lucene Index Performance by reuse Document and Field Instance,"There are many to improve Lucene Indexing performance, I have followed many tips from this site [ImproveIndexingSpeed Tips ](""http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/ImproveIndexingSpeed"") , including:Application of MultiThreads to Indexing by overwriting several method of the IndexWriter's  i.e: addDocument updateDocument, this brought me lots of performance improvement(about 7,8 times faster).Re-use of Document and Field instances. According to the tips, it says :"" It's best to create a single Document instance, then add multiple Field instances to it, but hold onto these Field instances and re-use them by changing their values for each added document"".The first tip brings good performance improvement, but the second one does not. I made Document ,Field static instance so it won't be instantiated every time,(saved creating overhead and resources).Used Field setValue method to change values in it ,then add them to the doc instance.After I ran the Indexing, the process stuck in the endless loop. I guess it's because of the  MultiThread's side effect, it locked the Document and Field instance and prevent other Threads to addDcoument.  My Question is  :What is wrong about the "" Reuse "" part ?

Storing multiple phone numbers in a single array in Java,"I'm working on a program and I'm stuck. This particular program is supposed to prompt the user to input either an uppercase or lowercase Y to process a phone number, they are then prompted to enter the character representation of a phone number (like CALL HOME would be 225-5466), this repeats until the user enters something other than the letter Y. All of the words entered are to be stored into a single array. The program is then to convert these words in the array to actual phone numbers. I'm kind of confused as to how to set this up. Here is what I have so far. I realize that the second method doesn't have anything to return yet, I just wanted to put that in there while I was doing things that I actually know how to do ha. The convertNum() method is supposed to be the method with which the array of characters is converted to phone numbers.I'm still trying to think my way through this. I would think it'd be easier to store the inputs from the user as individual letters rather than words for the sake of converting to phone numbers.Also, we are only supposed to recognize the first 7 letters of each word that is entered, like the CALL HOME example, there are 8 letters but it's still a seven digit phone number, so I'm not sure how that would work.Also, when printing the phone numbers after they've been converted, we're supposed to print the hyphen after the third number, I have no clue how that would be done from an array.I was actually feeling pretty good about this program until I reached this point ha.

So i would love to have something like src/main/dart and src/test/dart or something.I would also like being able to run dart in the stand alone vm (stand alone application) instead of the web / browser to simplify some development steps like the development of the model / business layer and add simplified testing. Also we want to evaluate if there is the possibility to start dart side processes on the server for additional simplification.So the scenario is:Put dart files anywhere (especially in the source tree)The web framework is non-standard programmer friendly, we can simply add resources from anywhere under virtual directories (src/main/dart -> localhost/dart/)The dart files will be converted to js prior to checkinDart should be able to pickup the right files on debugTesting and debugging should be possible in standalone mode and in using DartiumSo how can I do this what should I be able to configure.Update2:Dart will be used as a JavaScript replacement here. So in the end this is a mid-size web project where the JS/Dart code provides the glue to make the pages functional. It also will drive the backend application which might be single paged but its not decided yet. Best would be to see the dart application as of two applications at once where the backedn application is distinct from the front end functionality that is dynamically added as needed.For the compilation process to JS I would not mind to create a simple program copying files, compile and recopy files and done. Wouldnt take that long since it would be only needed once or twice a day.",0

How to add Tomcat 8 to Eclipse Kepler without installing the big whole WTP package,"Ok I am running with Eclipse Kepler.

REST annotations injection together with injection of custom XML objects in one request,"1)I'm dealing with similar situation like at How can I pass complex objects as arguments to a RESTful service? , but actually the injection of my custom XML objects if injected all right, IF i do not annotate method parameter with @Form.This is wrapper request object to injection:So this would inject me REST parameters (e.g. {value} - @PathParam(""value"") annotated in TestRequest).BUT this doesn't unmarshall the XML object Test in wrapper object TestRequested. And following definition would inject only the XML object Test but doesn't inject the REST annotations (e.g. {value} from URI):2) I also tried another approach by catching request to custom MessageBodyReader implementation but have been lost in the details where to find code, method or class of JAX-RS or RESTEasy that actually does this parsing/injecting of REST annotations(@PathParam, @QueryParam,...).I also noticed that when there is @Form annotation in method definition, then custom MessageBodyReader isn't even catched (propably built-in one for REST parameters catches that request and custom reader is then ignored). I could in this custom message body reader solution somehow call that built-in injection provider but i didn't find suitable documentation and it seems I'm doing something wrong and all can be done more simplier some other way.To summarise the goal: inject both REST parameters (@PathParam, @QueryParam etc.) and custom XML/JSON objects somehow in one request in ONE wrapper object. (It works with one wrapper object annotated @Form and the other parameter to be without @Form annotation, but I would like to have all in one wrapper object).Thank you for any insights or help.",1

Spring post redirects to access-denied while get works,"I apologize for a somewhat duplicate post, I asked a question about this yesterday however I did not do a good job of stating the problem and because of this the feedback was not useful. I have since learned more about the problem and can put it in a more clear and concise way which will hopefully help solve this.Whenever I try to post to a page the controller maps the url to  the access-denied-handler as specified by mvc-dispatch-servlet.xml. If I try to get to a page then it hits the correct @requestmapping and everything is ok.I have tried adding     which does nothing. I have just recently narrowed this problem down to which seems to be blocking the post operations. If I change this to /pages/* then I can post to a page that is /ReceiveFile because it is mapped that way in web.xml. This skips the main controller altogether. With that setting if I try to go to pages/ReceiveFile it still goes through the controller and goes to the 403 page. I don't believe bypassing my controller with all post operations is a good permanent solution.How do I allow these post operations to go through?Thanks!Main Controller.javasome code cut to reduce unnecessary length mvc-dispatch-servlet.xmlspring-security.xmlweb.xml",1

Java String Tokenizing for a Programming Language Parser,"A few months ago, I thought it would be cool to make my own programming language. So I did. I named it [Pogo](""https://github.com/nrubin29/Pogo""). If you look at the code, you'll see a ton of String#split. Here's some pseudocode that describes how I parse a method header:Given method public void main(), I look to see if String#startsWith(""method""). If so, I String#split("" "") and parse the second word (public) to a visibility. I treat the third word (void) as the return type, and check to see if it's a primitive or class. Finally, I treat the last word as the name and parse any method parameters properly.This method works, but I know it's wrong. You're supposed to tokenize everything and handle it like that. However, I don't quite understand how that would work. I know I'd use Java's StringTokenizer, but how would I parse a method header? Given method public void main(), the first token would be method. I'd know I'm working with a method, but I can't instantiate my Method class because I don't have all the information yet. It seems like I'd have to declare a loop for the StringTokenizer and have tons of variables outside of it, which almost seems worse than what I have now.tl;dr: How should I use String tokenization to parse a custom programming language. I'm not really looking for code, more like pseudocode or ideas.Thanks!",1

my implementation of viewpager confused me a lot on fragment/activities,I am running a tab pager adapter but I cannot seem to understand how to implement code not located in the Main Activity.

Proguard complains about missing classes in external JARs. How to solve this correctly?,"I am trying to obfuscate an Android 4+ app that uses Dropbox with Proguard in Eclipse. So far I have no experience with Proguard and thus I used different tutorials and answers here on SO to configure my proguard-project.txt:When I try to export the APK using the File/Export.../Export Android Application/... dialog the creation fails with an Proguard error:First Thing I tried was to add some -libraryjars ... commands:This does not solve the problem. In fact now there are 2468 duplicate class definitions (367 before...)The next I tried is to ignore the warnings:This solves the problem! The creation of the APK now runs without any error. Fine... But I don't have a good feeling about this. Is ignoring warnings really the best way to solve this issue? Is this the ""corrent"" way of handling such issues?When I run the APK on my device and try to use the Dropbox functions the app crashes. But this can be solved by adding the following:This protects the Dropbox code from being obfruscated. But again I am not sure if this is the right way to handle this.So far the app seems to work fine with this configuration. But is there any way I can be sure Proguard did not broke anything (beside running a complete beta-test of every app function everytime the app is created?)Thank your very much!",0

Double Brace initialization Type Confusion,"I thought this was going to be relatively easy, but alas, it seems it isn't.I am currently writing Unit-Tests for a Facade-like structure in my Project using Java EE 6.For the Tests I use Junit 4.11, with Eclipse Kepler as IDE.From what I can see, there seems to be something ""wrong"" with double brace initialization, but I am not knowledgeable enough to put my finger on why it doesn't work as I think it should.To get to the point, I am using following Class to make conversions in a centralized place:As far as this goes it's mostly playing with generics and a static map.

Maven dependency not getting corresponding POM file downloaded,"I've got a maven project that has a dependency that it gets from a remote Nexus repository. I believe that the dependency was not built with maven, and just uploaded with a barebones POM file. The layout on the server looks fine though, so it was probably deployed with maven.When maven downloads the dependency to my local repository, it downloads the jar file, but doesn't get the POM. At build time, there's a warning that the POM couldn't be found, and no dependency information available. I'm not actually using any of its code directly (it's actually a transitive dependency), so build completes successfully.The real problem arises when I try to perform site generation for my project. The part that tries to generate the dependency graph report fails, because it can't find the POM for this dependency to work with.I can't figure out why I'm not getting the POM downloaded, when the jar file for it gets downloaded just fine.The POM file for that particular dependency looks like this (you can see why I don't think it's built with maven :))You'll notice that the root  element doesn't contain any namespace or schema information. Could this be related? Could it be Nexus not recognizing it as a POM? Apart from the possibility of some small syntactical character missing or mistaken, this is my current train of thought...please don't let it influence any ideas you may have! :)Also, while troubleshooting, I've pasted the contents of the remote POM file into the correct file location in my local .m2 repo. Everything works fine when I do that. This isn't an acceptable fix though, because we will need the build to be done on our CI build servers.Any help/suggestions greatly appreciated!Edit:I've managed to temporarily solve my actual problem, but the strangeness here still exists. I solved the problem by explicitly excluding the thing that depends on this from the dependency that's in my pom (the trouble dep is two steps away at least, and I'm not using anything that uses the thing that pulls it in):I've created a dummy project to prove it, with the following POM:Now in ~/.m2/repository/com/company/compnent/bad-artifact/1.0.1/, I've got:With no actual POM file.",0

If you are sure you're not intentionally defining acore class, then this is the most likely explanation of what'sgoing on.However, you might actually be trying to define a class in a corenamespace, the source of which you may have taken, for example,from a non-Android virtual machine project. This will mostassuredly not work. At a minimum, it jeopardizes thecompatibility of your app with future versions of the platform.It is also often of questionable legality.If you really intend to build a core library -- which is onlyappropriate as part of creating a full virtual machinedistribution, as opposed to compiling an application -- then usethe ""--core-library"" option to suppress this error message.If you go ahead and use ""--core-library"" but are in factbuilding an application, then be forewarned that your applicationwill still fail to build or run, at some point. Please beprepared for angry customers who find, for example, that yourapplication ceases to function once they upgrade their operatingsystem. You will be to blame for this problem.If you are legitimately using some code that happens to be in acore package, then the easiest safe alternative you have is torepackage that code. That is, move the classes in question intoyour own package namespace. This means that they will never be inconflict with core system classes. JarJar is a tool that may helpyou in this endeavor.

"Jenkins and Maven, abort build on BUILD FAILURE during generate-test-resources","This is a maven build, running on Jenkins. Version numbers listed at the end of this post. I'm trying to figure out how to abort my build when I get an error in the generate-test-resources phase.Requirement: During maven's generate-test-resources phase, I have processes that run on a remote server (iSeries). From those calls, I retrieve a success flag (true or false). When I get false, I'd like to mark the ENTIRE build as BUILD FAILURE, and abort the build.The code I run in generate-test-resources is in Java, but it submits jobs to the iSeries, and the real work is done in those submitted jobs.Rational: My primary purpose of this build it to execute JUnit test cases. The generate-test-resources phase calls processes to initialize the test environment. If the generate-test-resources phase is not 100% successful, the tests will likely pass, but those results would be invalid.Furthermore, when generate-test-resources has issues, but all the test cases pass, Jenkins reports BUILD SUCCESS. Very strange.Example: Here is an example from my log. I know that my call to MY_BUILD_COMMAND calls back to the server correctly, and it is successful most days.  But when there is an error, I need to trap it.  Notice I have the status at ""success? = false""And then, at the end of the log:Versions in use:maven-complier-plugin = 2.3.2 exec-maven-plugin = 1.3 Jenkins ver. 1.539JUnit 4.11",0
Does actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) runs in a different thread than the Event Dispatch Thread (EDT)?,"Does actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) runs in a different thread than the Event Dispatch Thread (EDT)? Say I wrote the following code:Though running javax.swing.SwingUtilities.isEventDispatchThread() returnd true in all three cases, it sill is impossible to do a++ inside actionPreformed. I debugged this  project, and correct me if I'm wrong: all though the entire frame is running from within the EDT, the EDT initiated new different threads for the Frame() constructor, and for the actionPreformed() function. Then, because of that, in order to escape the possibility of actionPreformed() will use the variable a that was created in another thread that could end before the actionPreformed()'s thread, its not possible to have a as a regular ''int'', only ''final int'' is permitted.1 So does the actionPrefromed() function in this example runs in a different thread than the Frame() constructor's thread?1.1 If not, then why isn't possible to modify a in the actionPreformed() funcion? 1.2 If yes, then how could I store values that could be kept in the Frame() constructor? or could at least be accessed by other different buttons? 2 Why create the frame f, or setting it to visible should be done inside the ETD in the first place?

How to add Spring jars to Java Project mirroring folder in git repo,"Long title, but pretty much explains it.  I've pulled a git repo (spring rest tutorial [http://spring.io/guides/tutorials/rest/](""http://spring.io/guides/tutorials/rest/"")) which contains multiple standalone java projects each in separate folders.  Each of these projects contains gradle build files as well as gradle itself (no need to install gradle), AND the necessary Spring jars (likely in the gradle-wrapper jar).  I've created a java project in eclipse that mirrors one of the folders and the changes in eclipse are picked up no problem and it builds fine.The problem I have is that the Spring dependencies aren't on the Eclipse build path, so I can't use all of the nice Eclipse features (function completion, auto imports, etc.).  There's only one jar in each separate folder from the git repo and it's called gradle-wrapper.jar.  My guess is that this contains all the Spring dependencies, as the project builds fine, assuming I've typed everything correctly and manually added correct import statements.   Is there a way to set this up so that I'm not getting all these ugly errors in the java project?  I attempted to add the gradle jar to the java project build path, but this had no effect.  I suppose one option would be to add the spring dependencies separately, but then the Spring on the build path wouldn't necessarily match the Spring dependencies used by gradle for the actual build.",0

no persistence provider for EntityManager named persistence.xml,"This is not a duplicate as the tag above purports.  This question has not yet been answered.  I am trying to set up [this tutorial](""http://confluence.highsource.org/display/HJ3/Purchase+Order+Tutorial"") to get hyperjaxb to work in an eclipse project.  How can I get it to see a persistence provider?  hbm2ddl has NOT created the table structure in the database yet.  Is that why the app is not seeing a persistence provider?

Also, hyperjaxb creates a persistence.xml and places it in the target folder.

Why does Chrome Java updater installs a global 32bit JRE on a 64bit machine?,"Recently I updated the JRE through the update process which chrome (Version 38.0.2125.104 m) offers (""your java is outdated and needs an update"" or similar). The result was that my eclipse luna (64 bit) did not execute anymore. Looking closer to the background I detected: the chrome java updater (notabene started from an Oracle site) added C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath in front of the env var PATH. This folder contains three symbolic links to the newest java 8 JRE installation in (x86) program folder -> hence to a 32 bit java JRE. Obviously Oracle replaced (with Java8) the old technique - having the java launchers in system32 (for 64bit applications) resp. SysWOW64 (for 32bit applications) - with this new approach. But: In these locations there still are the ""old"" java.exe/javaw.exe/javaws.exe, notably also actual versions (same file date as the new symlinks).My questions are: a) what is the reason for installing a global 32bit JRE on a 64bit machine?b) Is there a better approach to solve the problem than just deleting the new path entry?",0

How to disable Hibernate validation in a Spring Boot project,"I have a spring boot project that has a CrudRepository, an Entity and a Controller. I am basically trying to persist an entity based on the data passed to the Controller.To do this, I am using spring-boot-starter-jpa. My Entity is annotated with JSR-303 annotations, which are checked in the controller before the data gets passed to the CrudRepository for persistence.Controller method:Entity:The cause of my issues is the UserUnique annotation. Its validator looks like this:What seems to be happening is, the validation is getting run twice. Once in the controller via the @Valid annotation, and once when Hibernate tries to persist the object. However, when Hibernate tries to persist the object, it throws:This seems to be because its not spring-aware and cant inject the dependency into the constructor. So, what I want to do is disable Hibernate validation completely (as its redundant and already happening in the controller).There seems to be a property called javax.persistence.validation.mode which you can set to none. However, I cant for the life of me figure out where to set it in a code-based configuration.I realise there are questions like JSR-303 dependency injection and Hibernate but these are all using xml config and manually configuring parts of the persistence layer.What I want to do is ""post-configure"" the required parts of the persistence layer that Spring Boot creates for me because if I define my own then I am no longer leveraging Spring Boot's auto configuration. Can anyone help me determine if 1) this is possible and 2) which parts do I need to configure and how?Thanks!",1
Elasticsearch client maven dependencies,I have a webapp that takes advantage of Elasticsearch. I use an Elasticsearch standalone server and from the webapp side the transport client to communicate. Currently I include the org.elasticsearch:elasticsearch:jar:1.3.4 dependency in my pom.xml and everything works fine. The point is that this dependency along with the transitives sum up to 20MB which is ridiculous. I just want to use the transport client. Is there a more lightweight client dependency?

How to correctly import files in a maven project structure?,"I have a configuration file in xml format, that I need to load into my java code. While testing, I have imported it through it's absolute URL, but now I am about to compile and deploy the project as a jar, and that won't work anymore.From previous experience, I think the right way to do this, is to use the ClassLoader, but I'm having some difficulties. Maybe because of my project setup, I do not know. I think I would be able to make this work, as I ahve done in the past, but I really want to make sure I do it the standard, conventional and/or correct way, so that I do not need to experiment every single time this comes up.Here is the code I've tried to implement: [http://www.mkyong.com/java/java-read-a-file-from-resources-folder/](""http://www.mkyong.com/java/java-read-a-file-from-resources-folder/"")However, this code:I could not use, due to needing the file in a static method of an abstract class.

How can I add more than one database record to my HashMap?,"I have a HashMap that I am using to store information from my database. I have a Result Set that reads from each column of the database, and the Result Set is used to initialize a few string variables. These strings are then used in the HashMap. For example, one of my lines of code for my HashMap is parameters.put(""CertificateCode"", CertificateCode);. From what I'm beginning to understand, the first parameter of the HashMap allows the application to know WHERE to put the information, and the second parameter tells the HashMap WHAT information to put in.Here is my problem... I noticed that if I try to run a loop through these lines of code, it will simply replace an existing value in the HashMap with the new one, thus only displaying the last record from my database.How would I go about making the HashMap allow for the storage of multiple database records? I need this to work in a way that would still allow me to pass the parameters in to my Jasper Report. This method is JasperPrint jasperPrint = JasperFillManager.fillReport(), and it requires the parameters of JasperReport, Map, and a Connection.I thought it might work if I added an array list to the HashMap. However, the ""fillReport"" method will not accept this as a proper parameter.Any help would be much appreciated! I have been fighting with this reporting library for way too long now.Thank you.",1

"Trouble running Java application implementing Stanford POS tagger as a .jar, runs fine in NetBeans IDE","I am trying to implement Stanford's POS tagger in a Java application using the following lines of code:It works fine when running the project in NetBeans, but the executable .jar compiled in NetBeans will not run the tagger.  I am fairly new to Java and to programming in general, and I haven't figured out how to log whatever error/exception is occurring in the GUI console of the application, and no error/exception occurs when running the project in NetBeans.  A couple things occurred to me that could be happening.  The Stanford NLP group says: ""The system requires Java 1.8+ to be installed. Depending on whether you're running 32 or 64 bit Java and the complexity of the tagger model, you'll need somewhere between 60 and 200 MB of memory to run a trained tagger (i.e., you may need to give java an option like java -mx200m). Plenty of memory is needed to train a tagger. It again depends on the complexity of the model but at least 1GB is usually needed, often more.""  [http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml](""http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.shtml"")In the shortcut that I use to run the application, I specified the path of a javaw.exe that is version 1.8+, and I also tried replacing the latest release of the tagger with the August 2014 release, pre-Java 8 upgrade, and neither solved the problem.     As for the memory issue, I went to my Java control panel and entered ""-Xms1024m"" as a runtime parameter for every javaw.exe on my machine, and that also did not solve the problem.  Can anybody suggest what might be making the .jar fail to run the tagger, when it works fine running the project from NetBeans?     Thanks!",0

I would like it to stay in the sub-menu/series menu until the user chooses 'q'. import java.util.Scanner; // Scanner is in the java.util package//import java.util.ArrayList;//import java.util.List;class FloatWrapper {  public float value;  public FloatWrapper(float param) {    value = param;  }}public class BasicCalculator {  public static void main(String[] args) {    int menuOption = 0;    //List myList = new ArrayList();    double[] myList = new double[5];    //ArrayList myList = new ArrayList();    int counter = 0;    while (menuOption != 'q')      do {        menuOption = mainMenu();        switch (menuOption) {          case 'a':            {              switch (seriesmenu()) {                case 'a':                  myList[counter] = dataInput();                  counter++;                  break;                case 'q':                  mainMenu();                  break;                default:                  seriesmenu();              }            }            break;            //case 'b' :            //case 'c' :            //case 'd' :            //case 'e' :          case 'f':            display(myList);            break;            //case 'g' :            //case 'h' :            //case 'i' :            //case 'j' :          case 'q':            System.exit(0);            return;        }      }      while (menuOption != 'q');  }  //Main Menu Display  static char mainMenu() {    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);    System.out.println(""\n\nBASIC CALCULATOR"");    System.out.println("" a.

How to parse a ISO 8601 String to Java Date on Android,"I'm creating an app on Android which communicates with a server.

I've tried different masks, using a Locale, not using a Locale, and nothing seems to work for me.I've seen on this link that The SimpleDateFormatter doesn't support ISO 8601 very well, and that guy gave a solution using javax.xml.bind.DatatypeConverter.parseDateTime() method, but the DatatypeConverter is not present on the Android SDK.

Application class gets recreated after opening some other applications,"I'm new at developing Android. I'm experiencing the following problem: I'm working on a Android application that extends the Application class. The values for the authentication session are stored in this class, because it is supposed to get created once and it is available in all activitys and services. When I open my application and close it with the home button, and reopen it after I opened a lot of other apps, the base application class gets recreated (onCreate gets called). When this happens, I lose my authentication values. It seems like it that the onTerminate or onLowMemory are not getting called before the onCreate is getting called again. The current state of my application is not gone, because the previously active activity is still available.When I close the app with the home button and only open a few other apps, the application resumes normally.I also tried to implement a singleton class, but the singleton object is also null if the application class gets recreated.How can I prevent the recreation of the application class, or work around this problem?

How to use two URL mappings,I want to migrate my application to Spring Boot Jar Deployment.

Hibernate dependencies location in a multi tier application,"I have a specific question regarding the location of the hibernate-annotations jar in my maven project. My project consists of three modules. The modules Client and Server are both depending on the module Shared. Maven builds two packages for deployment: Client + Shared and Server + Shared.Annotated Hibernate entities are located in the Shared module since I need to pass them between the client and the server (via RMI).Now comes my problem. The hibernate-annotations.jar is used as dependency of the Shared module to allow compilation of the Hibernate entities. The library itself depends on hibernate-core. As result, I have the hibernate libraries in my deployed client application, even if I don't really need them there. The jars are quite big and I want to keep the client as slim as possible. Are there some established techniques to avoid this problem? One that comes to mind would be to use XML based Hibernate configuration so I could move the Hibernate dependencies to the Server module, but I would like to stick to annotations.Thanks.",0

Maven recursive dependency exclusion,"Let's say I am developing project A that depends on project B and JUnit-11.

"Assignment operator and ""this"" keyword","Consider the following code snippet: The above would throw a syntax error: The left hand side of an assignment operator must be a variableIn java, the this keyword stores the memory address of the current calling object.

For example, in the French language, every verb has to end with 'er', 'ir' or 're'. All verbs have certain features in common.

Maven find dependency having a transitive dependency in a specific version in a remote repository,"Edit: ""Reverse Dependency analysis"" would have been the keyword for what i searched - unfortunately I was not able to proper describe my question (maybe it has something to do with this not beeing a standard thing - i acctually dont even have a real usecase for this).Say i have a typical convergence issue and the dependency:tree tells me something like this:[INFO] com.my.group:myProject:jar:1.0.1[INFO] +- org.not.my.group:a-direct-dependency:jar:1.1:compile[INFO] |  \- org.not.my.group:transitive-dependency-A:jar:1.14.0:compile[INFO] \- org.not.my.group:another-direct-dependency:jar:1.1:compile[INFO]    \- (org.not.my.group:transitive-dependency-A:jar:1.18.0:compile - omitted for conflict with 1.14.0)is there a way to analyze a central repository (with nexus webgui available as well) to find out if there is a (newer) version of org.not.my.group:a-direct-dependency:jar that relies on the transitive dependency org.not.my.group:transitive-dependency-A:jar but in version 1.18.0 instead of 1.14.0?Or generally asked: Can i find out who is depending on a artifact via the central repository (or any remote repository) similar as i would find it out using this locally?:mvn dependency:tree -Dincludes=org.not.my.group:transitive-dependency-A:jar:1.18.0 -DverboseFor further clarification: In the above (fictive) szenario i would solve the convergence issue using three ""levels"" of solutions whereas the first will whenever possible be the choice and the latest is ""a dirty correction"". 1 - Allign versions: If my dependencies - own or third party - direct or transitive - do rely on the same artifact X but define a different version i preferably try to find a newer release of X or a dependency in the tree to X that has a common version to the rest of the dependencies. This way i assume ""a proper upgrade"" of X because they may needed to apply code changes. 2 - exclude dependency: If i am not able to find such a artifact i will successivly try to exclude the lower versions in the hope the dependency that has this exclusion can handle the newer version. This requires intense testing since i dont have the guarantee of a newer release that properly points to the version - i basicially tell maven ""this dependency will work with another dependency of version  as well even thus i have no idear of the internal design of this dependency"" - even if compilation works i may still experience runtime issues.3 - use dependencyManagement: Since using the dependencyManagement can lead to ""mask"" (hide/outpass) certain convergence issues for the enforcer plugin i acctually dont consider this a solution (for my setup) anymore .... say i experienced a convergence issue and solved it using the dependencyManagement - later - one of the transitive dependencies changes and lead to a similar convergence issue that the enforcer plugin is not able to detect anymore.

ActiveMQ Dead Letter Queue isn't created,"I'm trying to use configure and test ActiveMQ dead letter queue, but I have some issue.

Messages are normally redelivered to a  client in the following scenarios:       A client is using transactions  and calls rollback() on the session.   A client is using transactions  and closes before calling commit.   A client is using  CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE on a session and calls recover() on that session.  So, I've made my Producer class to create transactional session and rollback transaction after message is sent. As I expected, message didn't appear in the destination queue, but trouble is that DLQ wasn't created at all. How can I manage dead letter queue?

Is it possible to copy all resource files (without naming them specifically) at runtime?,"I have a number of resource files I want to copy to another location as a method call. There are various how-tos and guides, and questions here on SO about how to read/copy files from a JAR.

How to organize files from dependencies in a Maven shaded jar,"When you build a fat jar using the [maven-shade-plugin](""https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/""), there might be conflicts between files at the same path but originating from different dependencies. Similarly, it becomes hard to distinguish the origin of various dependency-specific files located at the root of the individual dependencies (LICENSE.txt, native libraries, ...) when they are placed side-by-side at common locations in the shaded jar.maven-shade-plugin itself and the similar [jarjar-maven-plugin](""https://sonatype.github.io/jarjar-maven-plugin/"") appear to provide functionality for automatically relocating classes, but not other files from the dependencies, such as those seen in the following example:Example of current messy structureThis is an example from a project I just started. None of the files above were added by me, but all come from various popular third party libraries I'm using. I would like to clean up this mess by having Maven reorganize files in a common package structure like in the following example:Example of desired clean structureI have many dependencies, so I don't consider writing dependency-specific filters/relocators/... with hard-coded filenames a good solution to this problem.How do you organize all files from dependencies in your shaded jar automatically?

The flags are being triggered in the startElement() as they should when an element is encountered.I set a breakpoint on the boolean variable description in charaters() but the boolean isn't set to true until startElement() is called, meaning the PCDATA is never parsed.My question is how can I call the characters() after the boolean values are set in startElement() ?This is the startElement() which is called after the charaters():The charaters() is called as soon as the program starts, but it needs to be called after the boolean flags are set in the above method:Sample of one of the locations within the XML file:",1
Why does java use System.out.print/println instead of just print or println?,"This post may be considered to be inappropriate for stackoverflow, although I'm not trying to insult the Java language or anything like that. I enjoy coding in Java, but there is something regarding System.out.println that I have been wondering for quite a while.Why is it that we are always forced to type System.out.println() or System.out.print() every time we want to print? Sure, we could make a void function to save time and energy in programs that we will have several print statements (which I sometimes do) like so:and then just call print (and if you want to really be thorough you can overload the function with arguments involving ints, doubles, chars, etc). But why is it that the Java language itself doesn't already allow us to print to the console by just writing print? Some languages (such as Python) make printing to console that neat and simple - so why doesn't Java? Again - I'm not saying that the Java language is poorly designed, or trying to start a thread that is intended to bash Java. I'm sure the language designers had their reasons for designing it the way they did, and it would help me to understand why it is so. It would be much easier to just need to type print instead of System.out.print, so there must be reasons for why we must type System.out.print - I just can't figure out those reasons. I've tried googling for information on this issue and can't find anything relevant to the issue.Please refrain from opinionated responses about the Java language - I want actual facts that explain this phenomenon.",0

How to implement stack trace when there is a failure?,"I recently had an interview and was asked to design/implement stacktrace functionality.

Using Maven for a client-server project with external dependencies,"I am working on a game that is split into 3 projects: client, server and common.

Should each of my current projects become a separate Maven project? Or perhaps the common project should become a parent to the client and server projects? Or should all 3 of my projects become one giant super-project?My client project has a dependency on a couple of external JAR files; how do I set up this dependency in Maven? The documentation suggests that I need a groupId and artifactId, etc. Where do I find these? Does this system rely on the JARs being catalogued in some (remote or local) repository?I have a bunch of resources within the common project. I want these to be placed in the output directory as part of the build process, not inside the resulting JAR file. I read somewhere that all files in Maven's src/main/resources directory are automatically copied into the JAR file, so where else can I put them?The documentation explains how to use Maven on the command line to build the project. If I am developing in Eclipse, is the command line still the preferred way to run Maven, or will a plugin such as M2Eclipse achieve the same thing?Evidently my understanding of Maven is quite weak, so any advice / explanations / tutorials would be much appreciated.",0

Change Spring Boot project to inherit custom dependency management,"I have a small Spring Boot application which I must adapt to use a custom parent. Google finds lots of examples of how to migrate to Spring Boot, but I am at a loss as to migrate from Spring Boot (which I barely know to begin with).The reasonsTo make things short, this application was developed as a kind of a proof-of-concept and the developer chose state-of-the-art technologies.Now, this application will keep on living and we need to integrate it in our framework. As a Maven project, it should therefore inherit one of our common parent, though it is my understanding Spring Boot projects should inherit from the Spring Boot starter parent POM.[Edit] I was incorrect: it is possible to use Spring Boot without the parent POM. Removing Spring Boot is therefore not an obligation, but our parent POM includes its own version management, which obliges me to override several versions included in the starter.Why we need to inherit from our parentWe have an enterprise framework used across all our projects. To make things easier, we manage versions of many frameworks in our parent POM. Some examples where these versions conflict with the ones from spring-boot-dependencies in our little batch project:Spring framework (in-house: 3.2.4; Spring Boot 1.2.2: 4.1.5)Spring Batch (ih: 2.2.0; sb: 3.0.3)Velocity (ih: 1.5; sb: 1.7)Junit (ih: 4.11; sb: 4.12)... (we manage about 90 versions)I am obviously not at liberty to upgrade those versions. Please keep in mind this framework is used across many projects and any change could have dramatic and uncontrolled consequences.Additional contextThe objective is to get a little Spring batch application. It must take some input from the command line and return a 12 exit code if execution fails. Below is the core of the launcher but I am open to any better way to do it.Our batch launcher classIf totally abandoning Spring Boot, I would need to adapt this launcher class but, being mostly used to XML Spring contexts, I find this a bit difficult.The questionWhat is the best way to change my code to adapt my Spring Batch application so that I could use my own Maven parent?",0

"Android activity ""implements"" cannot resolve the symbol of a class method?",Then in  RotationGestureDetector.onRotationGestureListener it cannot resolve onRotationGestureListener. I feel like there is something tricky about the interface that Im not understanding but I really feel that this method is clearly defined here. My understanding is that the interface OnRotationGestureListener sets up an interface with an object rotationDetector that has all of the methods defined in the RotationGestureDetector class available to it such as getAngle(). But Im not sure why this means that you cannot access the interface from the class in the first place. Any suggestions especially with a clear explanation for why interfaces don't work this way would be awesome! ,1

Static Singleton Instance of Spring's ApplicationContext,"I'm trying to port an application written with CURAM to a Struts2 project.  We are using Spring to take advantage of its database transaction capabilities.  Do to the way application code is written in a CURAM application, I cannot use the Dependency Injection feature of Spring.  I need to be able to access the Spring ApplicationContext from anywhere in my business logic.  And creating a new instance of ApplicationContext whenever I need it grinds things down to a screeching halt.I found this resource on the internet that shows you how to create a static singleton instance of Spring's ApplicationContext.[Access the Spring-ApplicationContext from everywhere in your Application](""http://blog.jdevelop.eu/?p=154"")This would solve my issue, but I have concerns.  Wouldn't a static singleton instance mean that every user invoking a Struts2 action would be getting business objects from the same ApplicationContext instance?By default, Spring beans are singletons within an ApplicationContext instance.  Because of this, I'm thinking that a static singleton instance of ApplicationContext would cause the same instance of all business objects to be used by all users / transactions, which would ruin transactions and probably cause locks all over the place.  Am I correct in assuming this?What if I declared all of my Spring Beans as prototype?  Would that allow me to take advantage of Springs Database Transaction / Concurrency Handling capabilities while using a static-singleton instance of ApplicationContext?Thanks.",1

Need a GridBagLayout tutor for dummies please... with working example,"I'm trying to create a GUI that has a JXTaskPane, within which an HTML editor pane is showing some lengthy text, then below that are two sliders.

As for example let's assume the following data:E.g.: A task has:label (String)URI (String)Description (String)Activities (List of Strings)The only way I could successfully enter the list of activities, is by transforming the List of Strings to a String with the following code:This means in other words, I transformed the following list of activities:Decide on the change process; describe and declare it in the project management planRecord amendment requests in the change status list and update entriesAnalyze amendment requests and approve/reject themto the following String: ""Decide on the change process; describe and declare it in the project management plan. Record amendment requests in the change status list and update entries. Analyze amendment requests and approve/reject them.""Now, I want to get rid of this dummy approach and would like to add the list of activities as it is to the ontology but unfortunately I could not find out how to handle Lists/Arrays/Maps, ... in JENA. I would be happy for any help.Thank you.",1

Images(base64) not uploading correctly,Unfortunately I'm facing some issues when I try to upload some images from an android device to a database.The images are in a folder.

Maven define sub-dependency for included JAR dependency,"I am working on a Java project, using maven as our dependency manager/build tool. I am currently having a problem resolving a dependency's dependency to the correct version.The dependency in question is called jasperreports-functions-6.1.0.jar which is not hosted in a maven repo but provided in jar form.The problem I'm having is that jasperreports-functions needs commons-lang 2.6. Inconveniently, during ""compile"" Maven itself builds commons-lang 2.1 to create the reduced-pom. It seems this leads to jasperreports-functions trying to use commons-lang 2.1 because it is available, but this is not valid (method undefined errors at runtime.)

Netbeans 8.0.2 Clean and Build then Run results in old code being run,"I'm new to NetBeans and Java.  I'm using NetBeans to build and run a Java Swing project for school.I wrote my code in NetBeans and saved it.  Compiling from command line with javac is successful and the program runs as expected.  If I update the code and repeat the process from CLI, the new changes are reflected as expected.If I make a code change in NetBeans, and Clean and Build (e.g. by pressing Shift+F11), then run from in NetBeans (e.g. by F6), the changes are not reflected.  No errors, I just get a BUILD SUCCESSFUL notification in Output.  But an older version of the application will run with no changes reflected.I get around it by building from CLI but that's getting old really fast, it would be nice to be able to run from w/in the IDE.Following is some context code.  It runs as desired.  As an example of my problem, note the button initialization in File 2.  If I change the ctor string arg, the change will not be reflected when I clean, build, and run in NetBeans, (or if I just build and run without clean).  However, it will be reflected if run from command line.File 1:File 2:Update:I upgraded my version of Ant from 1.9.4 to 1.9.6 as a shot in the dark based on other postings I saw, it made no difference.Update 2:I was using only the Build and Clean and Build options, which are not for compiling an application to run within the IDE.  When a file is saved, NetBeans automatically compiles the project by default, as per:[the NetBeans documentation](""https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/java/quickstart.html#run"").  Likewise, if the user selects Run, all unsaved files will automatically be saved and compiled before NetBeans runs the application.  My problem was that I'm used to Clean and Build meaning something different, so I was running a Clean and Build every time I wanted to run the application in the IDE.  Once the Clean and Build or even the Build option is chosen in NetBeans, I haven't found a way to force recompilation for execution within the IDE other than making a trivial change to allow a resave of some file in the project.Update 3:Adding my project's build.xml by request.  I removed commented sections for readability.",0
how fix imports using a netbeans plugin /api,"I'm developing a NetBeans extension/plugin. Now I want to fix imports programmatically.

Spring: How can I unit test a DAO outside of a container without getting a NullPointerException for the EntityManger?,"Ive got two classes.  BatchDao, and BatchDaoImpl.  BatchDao is an interface, and BatchDaoImpl contains the logic.  You know the drill.I am quite new to Spring, which presents a problem for me.  How can I unit test the methods contained inside without using a container?  Normally I would just  write my methods as if they were just POJO's in JUnit and call it a day, as I did back in college.  However, I cant even get that far because my EntityManager(???) keeps giving me a NullPointerException, when I run my test in eclipse.  I understand it has something to do with dependency injection, but I dont understand what exactly is happening.  To the best of my knowledge, because I am not running this in some sort of container like TomCat, Spring isnt injecting anything, therefore my EntityManger would be null.  Ultimate question is how can I get around this?  Do I have to run my unit tests in a container?  That seems like bad practice.Code for BatchDao:Code for BatchDaoImpl:Code for the JUnit test:",1

Grief with Gradle and Maven repository for Android builds,"I have been having endless grief with Gradle for Android builds after I had to format my Macbook Pro for some stupid corporate domain migration. I have been using Gradle (both off the command line and with Android Studio) to build my projects for over an year now, and never had problems till the fresh install. I spent countless hours over the weekend trying to fix this, but with no luck, and I'm literally on the verge of tearing my hair out! Here is what I'm stuck with: Gradle builds have slowed to a crawlI have a multi-project (or multi-module in Android terms) project which used to take around 2 minutes for a clean build - plus uploading archives to the (local) Maven repository. Now,the Gradle configuration phase takes around 8 minutes! Nothing has changed, for after the fresh setup on the Mac, I just took a pull of the sources from the Github repo, and I'm building using the gradle wrapper (as before) which uses version 2.2.1. Not sure if this matters, but the Gradle version on my machine is 2.6. I use Maven - not for builds, but for the local M2 repository, and the Maven version is 3.3.3. Both Maven and Gradle were installed using Homebrew. The Gradle runtimes are the same whether of the command line or using Android Studio. I'm using Android Studio version 1.4-beta4. Here are the things I have set up: I have set up the Maven settings.xml to point the local Maven repository to the default location `${user.home}/.m2/repository I have set up Google repository using Android Studio and the Support repository (my project needs Play services and the support library) We need to upload the archives to the corporate Maven repository on our build servers; to sidestep this, I use the gradle.properties to define the repository URL to be the local M2 repository that's set up in the Maven settings The project defines Android build tools version 1.1.0, and while this is an older version, I tried with the latest 1.3.1 with no luck on the build times Possibly related: my Mac Pro uses a good ol' HDD, not the newer solid-state storage. While that can impact build times, the disk was not updated during the format, and also, I presume that it shouldn't result in such multiple orders of magnitude impact Failure in resolving artifacts from local M2 repoThe primary project that I work on is a library, and we have test clients that we use to verify functionality. The library and test clients are maintained as separate projects in the Github repo. To not have to make any changes in my local development setup, I prefer to deploy the artifacts from my library to my local M2 repo, and then have the test client define and resolve the dependency locally. I accomplish this using the global gradle.properties to override the repository URL (point it to the local M2 repo). This worked just fine till the disk format, but is broken since. Gradle is never able to resolve the artifacts, but I can see them in the local M2 repo. I have googled high and low (on Gradle forums, here on SO), but cannot seem to figure out what I'm missing or doing wrongly. As a work-around, I added the test client as a module to the library project, and am building it as a single multi-module project. BTW, even with this, I still run into the slow Gradle build times problem that I mentioned above. Can someone help me out? ",0

java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError when trying to instantiate class from jar,"I did found quite a lot about this error, but somehow none of the suggested solutions resolved the problem.I am trying to use JNA bindings for libgphoto2 under Ubuntu in Eclipse (moderate experience with Java on Eclipse, none whatsoever on Ubuntu, I'm afraid). The bindings in question I want to use are here:[http://angryelectron.com/projects/libgphoto2-jna/](""http://angryelectron.com/projects/libgphoto2-jna/"")I followed the steps described on that page, and made a simple test client that failed with the above error. So I reduced the test client until the only thing I tried to do was to instantiate a GPhoto2 object, which still produced the error. The test client looks like this:The errors I get take up considerably more space:libgphoto2 itself is installed, it runs from the command line, I even have the development headers and am able to call GPhoto2 functions from python, so the problem can't be located there.When looking at the .class files in Eclipse, however, they didn't have any definitions. So I figured that might be the problem, especially since there was an error when building the whole thing with ant (although the .jar was succesfully exported, from what I could make out the error concerned only the generation of documentation).So I loaded the source into eclipse and built the .jar myself. At this occasion Eclipse stated there were warnings during the build (though no errors), but didn't show me the actual warnings. If anyone could tell me where the hell the build log went, that might already help something. I searched for it everywhere without success, and if I click on ""details"" in eclipse it merely tells me where the warnings occured, not what they were.Be that as it may, a warning isn't necessarily devastating, so I imported the resulting Jar into the above client. I checked the .class files, this time they contained all the code. But I still get the exact same list of errors (yes, I have made very sure that the old library was removed from the classpath and the new ones added. I repeated the process several times, just in case).Since I don't have experience with building jars, I made a small helloworld jar, just to see if I could call that from another program or if I'd be getting similar errors. It worked without a hitch. I even tried to reproduce the problem deliberately by exporting it with various options, but it still worked. I tried re-exporting the library I actully need with the settings that had worked during my experiment, but they still wouldn't run. I'm pretty much stuck by now. Any hints that help me resolve the problem would be greatly appreciated.",0
SonarQube Eclipse plugin: incremental mode for changed files only,"I'm using the SonarQube Eclipse plugin v. 3.4.0, against a SonarQube Server v. 4.5.5 to analyze Java sources on several projects.The server analysis runs on a daily basis, against the latest sources from our Source Control Manager.As expected, whenever I perform an analysis using the SonarQube Eclipse plugin, it runs in incremental mode, i.e., it analyzes only the source files on my workspace which differ from the source files that were used on the last Server analysis.The problem is that I would like to have the plugin analyze only the source files I have changed on my workspace, and not all the files that differ between the workspace and server.I'm on the process of adopting SonarQube for our entire development team, whose projects are very dynamic (about 100 source files per day added/changed). The goal is to have every developer see only the new SonarQube issues that he has added, whenever it runs a local analysis using the plugin. But since it is highly likely that the set of sources each developer holds on his own workspace differs from the set of sources used during the server analysis, he will always end up seeing issues that were not added by him.Is is possible to have the SonarQube plugin analyze only the source files from the workspace that differ from the server and were changed, for example, by looking at the read-only file attribute?",0

When we override a method we should use all the parameters that are in the method signature?,"I found some overrides methods that not use all the parameters that are in the signature of the method.ex:Normally the parent class shouldn't be care about how the children will implements the abstract methods. But in MHO,  arguments of a method are to be use, it's very rare when a sub-class implementation doesn't need a parameter, when this happens then probably there's a problem with the design of the interface or with the abstract class.The base of one function is: inputs -> process of inputs -> output. Sometimes you need to calculate these inputs, but if you don't go to use some of these inputs in the process of your function, these inputs shouldn't be place as inputs of your function.You could jump the calculation of these inputs calling an accurate function that use all the inputs, so the accurate function.The only case where this situation could be acceptable, is when we don't want the behavior of the parent class, so we could write: OrSonar says :   Unused parameters are misleading. Whatever the value passed to such  parameters is, the behavior will be the same.My Question is: When we override a method we should use all the parameters that are in the method signature?When I says 'use all the parameters', I try to say that all the parameters that are in the method signature, are really use in the body (implementation) of the method.",1

Method cannot access the sorted array,"The following code sorts through a dictionary of words in lexicographical order. The problem is that I cannot access the sorted array outside of the for loop. Well I think this is the problem. I have declared the array words in another method and returned it to a private variable within the same class. But after I sort the array and try to print it out, it just prints out the original array. I also want to mention that this sorting method does work as I have tested it in another class where everything was in the main method. So again I believe my problem has to do with returning the new sorted array. I also need to write a few lines of code within the method after the array is sorted and when I tried to return the array, using ""return words;"" I was unable to write this code.",1
Should I use Fragments for Audio Processing?

ManyToMany on part of composite key,"First of all: I know there are plenty of similar questions here, but I've read most of them and all seems to adress slightly different issues, and no one had a satisfactory answer... So I still hope someone knows how to handle my problem...Simply said, I have an entity which has an composite key and I want to join a collection of other entities on part of this composite key. Unfortunately hibernate forces me to include the other part of the composite key into the join, leading to useless large join tables (>20m rows for 250 distinct value sets...). Therefore I want to exclude the unecessary part of the key from the join.Entity sketches:So this is basically A having a relationship with B which can have a certain value, which is stored in AB. One anomaly is, that B exists in multiple languages and AB should point to all of them.Does anyone know how to make this with Hibernate (without remodeling the Db... if possible. I know there might be better designs, but there are quite a few rows in this schema now...) ?",1

"Configuring build path works, but adding same dependency in pom does not","So I'm attempting to use org.apache.cxf.binding.soap.interceptor.SoapHeaderInterceptor in one of the modules of my project in Eclipse.Since this was a new jar that I was adding, I initially downloaded it myself and then added it as a referenced library under the project. All was good. I had my class extend SoapHeaderInterceptor, and everything was hunky dory.So once I was done coding everything, I removed the jar from the referenced libraries and instead added it to my module's pom like so:I did a Maven update on the project, and subsequently saw the jar added under the Maven Dependencies. I even opened up my local m2 repository and it's there as well.BUT I am now getting errors on the class (shown below)as follows:  The project was not built since its build path is incomplete. Cannot  find the class file for  org.apache.cxf.interceptor.AbstractInDatabindingInterceptor. Fix the  build path then try building this project    The type org.apache.cxf.interceptor.AbstractInDatabindingInterceptor  cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class  files AuthenticationInterceptor.java    The hierarchy of the type AuthenticationInterceptor is inconsistentNote: SoapHeaderInterceptor extends AbstractInDatabindingInterceptor.I've spent hours trying to figure this out and I am absolutely stumped. I have cleaned/built my workspace multiple times. The module that I added the dependency to actually already has several more dependencies from before, so it's not as though it's not configured for Maven. I see no error on the line that imports the package, so clearly it is finding the jar somewhere (the build path or the m2 repo). I'm using version 2.5.2 of the jar, and I know someone who has used this jar for the exact same purpose in the exact same way, successfully.The only thing I can think of that could be an issue (could someone confirm?) is that my local m2 repo has multiple versions of this jar, one older and two newer. Could this be causing some sort of conflict?Edit: On further inspection I see that org.apache.cxf.interceptor.AbstractInDatabindingInterceptor isn't actually there anywhere in my repo. I have the cxf.interceptor package in cxf-api-2.5.2.jar but it doesn't have this class. Any solutions? Do I have to use a different version of the jar?",0

IndoorAtlas Android SDK 1.4.2-132: getting the floorplan image/bitmap in fullscreen + with rotation,"So, apparently I am a newbie in Java, and the following is my story:I have been working with the IndoorAtlas (the company that provides Indoor Positioning Solution) Android SDK 1.4.2-132 and I am not getting the results I want when I test the application on my phone.Here is my full JAVA code which I mostly got from this link ""["":And here is my complete XML code ""indoor_positioning.xml"":In the Java code, I do not know what to assign and how to access those two variables called ""floorPlan"" and ""mFloorPlan"". I am also not sure if my XML code is correct, as I am not sure should I have customView or those two ImageViews? I do not know how to properly use the ""Util"" class (as it is mainly used for scaling the image/bitmap I guess), and other methods as you can see I have left them empty. The Java code is not complete, and that is why if somebody knows the answers and also knows what is missing inside the codes, that would be great. If you have been working with IndoorAtlas SDk or have worked with this SDK or an expert in using bitmaps, and if you know the answer, then please correct my Java program by pointing out the mistakes and by showing the correct codes.Here is image link which shows the actual result I am getting on my android phone: ""http://i.imgur.com/ySjBt3T.png](""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29911753/show-floorplan-and-get-location-with-indooratlas/29926176#29926176"">Show)""As you can see in the image that the floor plan is loaded and being shown on the top left hand corner of the screen with the blue dot inside.When I run the application on my phone, firstly, the blue dot loads, after that, floor plan bitmap is loaded and the blue dot goes below the floor plan image/bitmap and after that, the blue dot comes inside the floor plan.

dependencies for same jar having different trees,"I am trying to resolve an issue with a spring jar. I am using very old jars for A very old project.For one project my dependency tree is having spring-core 2.0.1 and for the other it is having Spring-core 2.0.2 now. they both are coming as a dependency of one jar : spring-ws-core:jar:1.0-m3.The issue I am having is the exception below: it turns out that the ClassUtils was changed from 2.0.1 to 2.0.2 and missed out this method. : and for the other:in my poms, I am not defining any versions for Spring-beans and Spring-core the only version I have defined is in the parent Pom which is org.springframework.ws:spring-ws-core:jar:1.0-m3:compileNow how can two projects having the same jar can have different dependent jars altogether.

Also, Somehow and strangely, the same war file works fine on my local windows wildfly9 but it gives me error on  a SunOS and Linux machine.Edit:I got the dependencyTree Idea from NoSuchMethodError for XmlSchemaCollection.read()and using that I found the two jars. As Harini suggested, I had already tried exclusion of the dependency and it still didn't work So I just refactored my code to have only one src and that too in the war (In wildfly war is loaded in its own classloader with its libs) So after refactoring as well, I got the same issue:How I got to know that it was the jar issue was I did a verbose on my jvm and saw this:[Loaded org.springframework.util.ClassUtils from vfs:/content/DirectRegistryServlet-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war/WEB-INF/lib/spring-core-2.0.1.jar]",0

How to add images to a JFrame project,"This has been confusing me for quite a long time now. The problem is that I want to display some images in a JFrame. I know how to do that, just use ImageIcon. However, it requires a path to the image. So if I compiled the project into a jar and gave it to my friend, the image would not appear because the image file is not on my friend's device!In Android Studio, the IDE takes care of these stuff. You just need to put the images into the drawable folder and it generates the code for you. The same applies to Visual Studio. I just need to ""Import"" the images.But I see nothing in Eclipse regarding image resources. How can I add images to the JFrame through an ""Image resource"" thingy?",1

"Swing - Key Problems (Arrow Keys, Tab, etc.) in GUIs with TextComponents","I want to bind the arrow keys to some specific actions for the whole window (no matter which component is focused).

When the JTextArea or the JScrollPane have focus all arrow-up, etc. key events 'get lost' (or rather only affect the TextComponent/Pane).Here is a little example which demonstrates the problem:In this example the Alt-ArrowDown command works, whereas the plain ArrowUp doesn't work.

How to use execution pointcut with third-party maven dependency?,"I am trying to develop an AspectJ aspect that will automatically swallow any ElementNotVisibleException or StaleElementReferenceExceptions (subclasses of RuntimeException) thrown by Selenium-Java's WebDriver instances (including multiple subclasses of WebDriver -- ChromeDriver, FirefoxDriver, etc.)Basically, the standard suggested solution in a non-AOP context for handling ENVE and SERE exceptions with Selenium is to simply try again. And again. And again, if necessary.Something like this would work in a functional paradigm:public void tryWhileStale(Runnable r){        int n = 0;        while(n Then, when using WebDriver later:tryWhileStale(() -> driver.findElement(By.xpath(...)).click());However, this adds quite a bit of extra typing (as well as the very real possibility of accidentally forgetting the tryWhileStale() wrapper) that I'd like to avoid.I don't want to download a copy of selenium-java, edit the source and rebuild, because I'm pulling Selenium directly from the public Maven repositories.I hoped that AspectJ would be able to figure out how to do this, so I did some research and realized I need an around advice with an execution pointcut. If I use call instead of execution, it will trigger successfully, but it won't swallow the exception. The reason for this is mysterious to me, since it seems from my code flow in the aspect I've written would catch anything thrown in the proceed() call.But an execution() pointcut won't work, either! This is because AspectJ is weaving my classes, but is not weaving Selenium-Java, even though I have a weaveDependency in my pom.xml! The kicker is that call() works only if your classes are woven, while execution() works only if the class you're calling is woven. Obviously, either one works if you have both your classes and the third-party classes woven.Is there any way to do this without abandoning AOP or Maven entirely? Below is my code that should purportedly work if I were able to weave selenium-java:@Aspectclass MyAspect {    @Around(""execution (WebElement *.findElement(By))"")    public Object around(ProceedingJoinPoint pjp)     {        Object f = null;        int n = 0;        do        {            try            {                System.err.println(""Before "" + this.toString());                f = pjp.proceed();                System.err.println(""After "" + this.toString());                return f;            }            catch(Throwable t)            {                try { Thread.sleep(5000); } catch(InterruptedException ie) { break; }                System.err.println(""Waiting 5 seconds because of "" + t.getClass().getSimpleName());            }            n++;        } while(n ",0

JAXB package-info.java declarations are ignored in separate maven modul,I use package-info.java to specify @XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.NONE) and some xml java adapters using @XmlJavaTypeAdapters.

Retrieving Primary Key Generated By Trigger (Java),"Here's what I'm attempting to do.  I have a Java program that decomms a telemetry stream into the individual raw fields.  I am passing these raw fields values into a MySQL table where each column is one of the fields.  In this database I also have a view that grabs all the telemetry data and calculates a few new derived columns based on raw data (e.g. raw counts to engineering units).  In my Java program, after insertion I would like to grab the corresponding row from the VIEW (raw + derived) and pass that data along elsewhere.Originally I thought I could simply insert the raw data into the VIEW and have the row returned to me in a ResultSet in the Java program.  Unfortunately the data isn't returned in a ResultSet.What I'm attempting to do now is insert the raw data into the table (this part works), get the primary key, then lookup the row from the VIEW.  The part I'm struggling with is retrieving the primary key from the INSERT.  I'm using a PreparedStatement generated from my Connection object and have supplied it with Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS.  However, when I call getGeneratedKeys() on my statement after I call executeUpdate() my ResultSet is always empty.  I can watch it insert the rows into the table while it's running...what am I doing wrong?Can I not retrieve the generated primary key in this fashion if the primary key is generated via a trigger?UPDATE: I've tried swapping out the Statement.RETURN_GENERATED_KEYS for a String array with the name of the primary key column, but that doesn't seem to work either.I apologize for not including my code, but it would be difficult for me to do so.

Http Requests With Bodies Crash Program,"I'm trying to sent a post request from a client to a server. At the moment both the client and server are running on my computer. Get requests are working fine, but post request break the client, and the server never sees them.Here's what my ServletHandler of my server (using jetty) looks like:Theline never gets called (I have a breakpoint on it in eclipse). However the doGet() line gets called all the time. The client can send gets without a problem.For the client I'm using the most recent version of apache httpclient from maven (I was using jetty but that was causing a similar problem, some nullpointer deep in their code when I tried to attach a Json, so I tried apache). Here's what my code looks like on my client for the post requests (broken):When I run this in debugger and step through line by line, I get to this lineAnd click ""next line"" in eclipse and it never reaches the next line. The program becomes unresponsive. Note: the variable s does in fact contain a well formed Json object, I checked.If I remove this lineEverything works. The doPost line gets called, the server can respond. It's all fine. I've even tried using a StringEntity from apacheHttpClient and it did the same thing.I supposed I could just include a named-value pair and map ""body"" to the json, but that's not what the api I'm using calls for.Please, tell me I'm stupid and it's an easy fix.Edit: debugger tells me s equals this string: {""row"":22,""col"":0,""type"":""rock""}",1
What is the use of the jar without dependencies Maven created for me?,"I am using Maven and my configuration (which is most likely the default) produces this:That means my compiled code is 4% of the file.

profiling maven dependencies for different branches,I work with spring framework (home project) and have two major versions of the same project (branches).The first one is a 'pure' spring framework using manually configured package dependencies inside pom.The second is for spring boot and because of spring-boot automation (concerning dependencies) it has slightly different dependencies inside pom.Question: Is there a way to have those two different pom's dependencies inside one file (something similar to profiles)? Or is there another better solution to keep this two configurations?,0

Maven-dependency-plugin and annotations with SOURCE RetentionPolicy,"In a mvn project where I am utilizing maven-dependency-plugin to detect unused dependencies, there is seemingly no dependency scope I can specify for Google's AutoValue (com.google.auto.value:auto-value) to that will convince the plugin that the dependency is being used in spite of the fact that annotations from the package are being used (e.g. @AutoValue) and the project won't build if auto-value is excluded.Now one solution is simply adding a configuration entry to my plugin:But I would be curious to know whether it's possible to configure either the maven-dependency-plugin or the dependency entry for auto-value in a way that would detect usage of the dependency per its annotations?My suspicion is that this isn't possible because the RetentionPolicy of the annotations I'm using from auto-value are of RetentionPolicy.SOURCE and are discarded by the compiler.

Application Design with a database call in multithreaded environment,"Requirement:I have a batch job that is processing 1 million records. I am storing the 1 million records in an Arraylist and iterating it to make a 3rd party external call for each record. Now the requirement is the third party will send a HTTP response 200 or 400 or 500. In the only case the response is 500, I have to update the database for that specific record.Problem:To speed up processing I am trying to implement threading for the 3rd party call. But I am stuck with the fact that after implementing threading how can I process the response from the 3rd party call to make the database update.I don't want to include the DB update inside the thread because in case there are multiple threads trying to update the DB, there will be a DB deadlock.My Effort:What I was trying is to declare a singleton arraylist and store the record number for which the response from the 3rd party call is 500 in the singleton object. When all the 3rd party call is complete I would iterate that singleton arraylist to fetch the records and update in the DB.RoadBlock:Even in this case I am unable to figure out how can I make the threading sequential so that I can store the record in the singleton arraylist.Code:Can anyone help me in getting this designed in the proper way.Threading needs to be implemented for performance improvement as the job processes 1 million records in one go and the job runs for around 12-13 hours.Thanks",1

Hibernate - OneToMany Bidirectional Insert resulting in null,"So, I'm making this webapp using Hibernate 5 and SpringMVC 4.I can't, for some reason, insert an entity with a OneToMany relation.Before I explain anything first I want to say that i tried many of the solutions posted here and other forums and neither worked for me... I don't know if I'm doing something wrong while trying to solve the issue.Here is my database:[](""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QSDvo.png"")Now, i recently added the phone table. Before this, I could add a profile object and it would cascade the inserts of the address and user entities on the same transaction. Now, with the addition of the phone entity to the code the persist operation keeps throwing me       Column 'ProfileId' cannot be null  All classes have their respective Setters and Getters... but to keep the code short, I removed them.___Between the solutions i found for similar cases than this was:To change the ProfileId column of the Phone table to make it allow null values, but keep the nullable = false on the JoinColumn annotation. The result for this was that it actually inserted the all the entities, but the ProfileId was also saved as null.Changed the cascade types... Still the same error.Someone said that EntityManager contexts that were colliding.. this is not my case.Set the JoinColumn annotation attribute nullable to false. Already did, is still on the code and is not working either.Set the Cascade type on both sides of the relationship. Also did, is also still on the code and is not working.Set the ManyToOne relationship attribute optional to false. Also not working.Being as new as I'm in this.. what i understand is that the ProfileId is receiving null because for some reason, after the insert of the Profile table, the generated id is not yet set on the profile object, which causes that the phone insert fails. But i have no idea how to solve.In case you need to know how I am persisting the objects...And the sessionFactory is autowired.The profile object has something like:And lastly the full error:Adding Requested Code.",1
Vtiger CRM REST API using Spring RestTemplate,"I am trying to create a Java wrapper for Vtiger REST API. I want to avoid the use of vtwsclib library because I could not find its Maven artifact.

Websocket handshake.

I increased the number of maxWarmingSearchers to 200 in my Solr config, because I was getting the error:  Exceeded limit of maxWarmingSearchers=2, try again laterAlright, but I don't think increasing that limit was really the right approach. I think the issue is that for each file, I am doing a commit, and I should be doing this in bulk (say 50k files / commit), but I'm not entirely sure how to adapt this code for that, and every example I see does a single file at a time. I really need to do everything I can to make this run as fast as possible, since I don't really have 85 days to wait on getting the data in Solr.Here's my code:Index.javaProducer.javaConsumer.javaSolrManager.java",1

Why hash maps in Java 8 use binary tree instead of linked list?,I recently came to know that in Java 8 hash maps uses binary tree instead of linked list and hash code is used as the branching factor.I understand that in case of high collision the lookup is reduced to O(log n) from O(n) by using binary trees.My question is what good does it really do as the amortized time complexity is still O(1) and maybe if you force to store all the entries in the same bucket by providing the same hash  code for all keys we can see a significant time difference but no one in their right minds would do that.Binary tree also uses more space than singly linked list as it stores both left and right nodes.Why increase the space complexity when there is absolutely no improvement in time complexity except for some spurious test cases.,0

How to serialize byte array and store it into database using active android?,"I have an image as byte[] and I need to save this image in database. I use Active Android library for this purpose. I know that data type in db for this purpose should be BLOB. I know that byte[] can't be stored directly and I know that it should serialized. But when I try to serialize it - problem arises. I tried to convert byte[] to String and then isnsert it to database- it worked: I saved it in database. But then, when I get this string back from db and convert it back to array of bytes, this array is not equal to the first one so when I try to decode this array as an image I receive   skia: --- SkImageDecoder::Factory returned null.My question is: what should I do to serialize byte array, save it into database, deserialize it back to byte array which will be equal to first one? Exactly steps I mean. I really was searching how to solve this problem for a very long time and I kindly ask you not to share here links to Active Android documentation or examples of TypeSerializer implementation for other classes - I saw that a lot of times.

Spring Batch Process Implementation on Existing Project,"Greeting guys! I'm working on the business based project developed on Spring MVC Framework with Angular JS. Now as part of my project there are some heavy processing that needs to be done which should run in background like File Processing, Validations, DB Store &amp; retrieval, Business Rules processing etc. I'm also newbie in these web based technologies so please help me out.  To achieve this I started with the Spring Batch Process, read the  tutorial from below:    docs.spring.io/spring-batch/reference/html/spring-batch-intro.html  (not allowed to post more than 2 links so pasting like this)    Understood the Tutorial and found some examples like below:    www.javacodegeeks.com/2015/03/spring-batch-tutorial.html  (not allowed to post more than 2 links so pasting like this)    [https://spring.io/guides/gs/batch-processing/](""https://spring.io/guides/gs/batch-processing/"")    (Since my existing Project is purely Java based (no XML based  configurations) so I searched accordingly and found above links  examples.)    Now while going through those examples, whatever the examples I saw  are only given of standalone implementation i.e. no existing project  implementation I found as such, so what I did was extracted the pom.xml  configurations from these examples &amp; integrated with the existing  pom.xml file.    So after this when I added the desired springbatch directory in my existing project from these examples and tried to run it using mvn clean install it started failing like below:    Spring-boot-maven-plugin repackage goal error using nar-maven-plugin    so I searched over the internet with the issue &amp; found conclusion as  mentioned in the above link and added an additional classifier line in  my pom.xml changes, so after that it started working fine &amp; then I was  able to generate the two war files.    So when I deployed those wars under the WildFly it started failing  continuously with very huge errors.    Below is my integrated POM File (the changes that I made in my original pom.xml file is present under double asterisks as below)  And this is the POM file of the example from the web that I used &amp;  added these changes in my actual POM.xml file.  I searched a lot over stackoverflow and other possible options via google but is out of luck. Being new to this Spring Batch Process I'm really not sure how to  proceed from here as this is a blocker for me and I'm struggling for 5  straight days. It's a kind request please advise how do I proceed so  that I'll be able to integrate the Spring Batch Process with my  existing application. Also this might be a duplicate issue but it  would be great if someone can point me to the better direction so that  I can start from there.    Logs after running the Wildfly:",1

How to interact with 2 dialog fragment lifecycle on Android?,"I'm very new to Android development. I have gone through many android tutorials and articles but I'm still a little bit confusing about my situation right now.What I need to do: I have two dialog fragment, f1 and f2. There is an audio playing in background. when any dialog pops up, stop playing audio, when dialog dismiss, audio resumes.What I have done:I have implemented a listener interface with 2 methods: onCreateDialog and onDismissDialog. It worked for just one dialog (f1 or f2 pops up, and audio stops. Dialog dismisses, audio resumes)What's not right:A situation that: f1 pops up, press ""yes"", f1 will dismiss, f2 will pop up. The audio will stop (actually it's already stop because f1 poped up), then the audio will resume. So I checked log, it seems that f2 onCreateDialog was called before f1 onDismissDialog, that's why audio resumed when f2 poped up.Does anybody have any idea what I could do about this situation?

Unit Testing - Theorem,"So, I've seen a video about TDD, where the presenter said, that you should unit test only the part of the class, what is give something out for the external world.

"Calling a method on a Thread - it works, but why?","I have the following Thread subclass (simplified slightly for readability):An instance of this thread is created by my client (using Swing GUI) when I connect to the server. What I find weird about it is that I can call the method send(Object data) from the main GUI, and it works. Why doesn't the infinite while loop and/or the call to in.readObject() prevent me from doing so? I mean shouldn't the thread be busy constantly doing other stuff? Is this a good way to do things? If not, why not? EDITTo clarify what puzzles me: If this was in the main thread, it would be busy on that in.readObject() until something was read, and then it would just start listening again on the next iteration of the loop. Of course, I get that I can call send() from another thread. But where my mind is blown is - ""who"" is actually executing send()? Is my Thread doing it, or is the calling thread doing it? If it's the former, how can it both be busy waiting for input in the while loop and executing the send() method? I just have a hard time wrapping my mind around it...",1

One for moduleD and one for moduleE, each of them containing the module's dependencies, including module A, B and C.I am using Maven 3 to manage my dependencies and the maven-shade-plugin to create the Uber jar.I have added the necessary dependencies in the pom.xml files like this:And I have added the maven-shade-plugin to the pom.xml files of each module. So far I am able to build an uber jar for moduleA and moduleB, but when I try moduleC I get the following error: How can I resolve this?If I build and run the modules trough IntelliJ everything works. Also I was able to build an uber jar by configuring an IntellJ artifact.How can I configure Maven to do this? I need it because I want to use an uber jar for production and I am trying to setup Jenkins to build the solution after a commit.I have red the following post: How to create self-containing (standalone) jar of each modules of a multi-module maven project but I was not able to make it work.

Weight in scrollview,"I have a task - make an activity like this [](""https://i.stack.imgur.com/XETw2.jpg"") Here photo takes one half of screen and text takes another. And everything works fine with weights, but sometimes text can take a lot of space and don't fit in screen, so I covered all my layout with ScrollView, but here comes problem. If everything doesn't fit into one screen everything should look that way - photo will take one half of visible screen and second half will contain some part of text that can fit there, and when I scroll, everything should be scrolled and new text will appear at the bottom. But I don't understand how to realize that, weights here work in some weird way and as I understood tag fillViewPort=""true"" makes something only if there is nothing to scroll, and when there is something this tag makes nothing.

Is there a way to use multiple maven dependencies for one maven project in Eclipse?,"I am developing a Bukkit plugin with the M2E plugin in Eclipse.

Storing dates in Hibernate as UTC time dates?,"I am facing an interesting question. On my local environment, I am on PDT time.

Maven pulling in dependency that is not specified in POM,"I have a maven project consisting of a parent POM and several sub-modules.

Adding Functionality to ArrayBlockingQueue,"I'm trying to add functionality to ArrayBlockingQueue, specifically I want the queue to only keep unique elements, i.e not enqueuing an entry if it is already contained in the queue.Since the functionality I desired is the same as the extension of Vector in item 4.4 of JCIP, I tried implementing it using the approaches there.Implementation by extending doesn't work, because ArrayBlockingQueue implements its mutual exclusion using a package private ReentrantLock, so as an extending class I could not get a reference to it. This would be a fragile approach even if it did work.Implementation by client side locking doesn't work, since there is no client side locking support.Implementation by composition seemed like the way to go at first, producing code such asUnfortunately, when composing an ArrayBlockingQueue, this approach yields a deadlock in the following simple scenario:Thread A calls take() and acquires the synchronized lock and the ArrayBlockingQueue's inner lock.Thread A blocks upon seeing that the queue is empty and releases ArrayBlockingQueue's inner lock.Thread B calls offer() with an element but can't acquire the synchronized lock, blocking forever.My question is, how is it possible to achieve this functionality without rewriting ArrayBlockingQueue?",1

Multi threading in Jboss,I want to see how Jboss creates/assign different threads from Thread pool once it finds previous thread busy.For that i tried to write down a code I hope making a thread sleep will make it busy and Jboss will create a new one. But it didnt work. I want my Test0 class to create 5 threads to execute run method of Test1 whenever it finds Test1 thread is busy in doing something. And I have Test0 class which will execute when jboss will start as followsNow in Test0 class I am manully creating 5 threads . How should i format the code to have Jboss create Thread from Thread pool?Will it make any difference if i call t1.run() instead of t1.start() while running on servers? Because i know t1.run will not create a new thread but so this still holds same in case of servers as well?,1

Specifying dependency from another dependency explicitly maven,I am writing a library that has following dependencies:``````Now the problem is - some of the users of this library also use it with dropwizard-core and in which case my library provides some additional features for the dropwizard framework and hence dropwizard-core is an optional dependency. Problem is - when user imports dropwizard-core - it automatically will include other dependencies I specified above (such as metrics-core) and in that case - the version imported via dropwizard-core may conflict with version explicitly specified.  How do I solve this?Bunch of users of this library will use it - without dropwizard-core and hence I don't want these users to import dropwizard-core (and hence atomic dependencies).,0

Android and Java: Reduce memory usage on a service loop,"I have an Android Service which updates a notification every second using this Thread (comments are not really relevant):The problem is that it uses about 20MB of memory but if I uncomment the ""//System.gc();"" line that number lowers to about 3/4MB, thats A LOT of garbage. But running the whole Garbage Collector every loop does not seem very efficient to me, and CPU usage goes higher.Thats why I don't like garbage collectors, on a c++ loop just by using auto variables I wouldn't have this problem, but I think this could be better done since I'm not really used neither to Java nor Android.So, my main question is, how can I lower memory usage in a more eficient way? I also would apreciate better ways to uptate a notification on Android but what I really need is to prevent this kind of code from using so many memory.UPDATE:Answers are suggesting that I should close the Stream, the Scanner, etc, I'm not really sure whether this is necesary or not (closing the stream and the scanner does not solve the problem) but I think that's not the problem since they are being succesfully deleted anyway.The problem is that they pile up before being deleted and I want to delete them just before the thread sleeps instead of waiting to the garbage collector, and since that cannot be done in Java as far as I know, I need a more ""garbage collector friendly"" aproach.",1

JerseyTest unsatisfied dependency (Dependency Injection),"I need to test my RESTful service and I thought the most appropriate way to do it would be using the [Jersey Test Framework](""https://jersey.java.net/documentation/latest/test-framework.html"") since I am already using Jersey for my service.However, when running a simple test I am getting a UnsatisfiedDependencyException because the implementation of the DAO I am using in the service is not found (it's being set via DI). This error used to happen to me everytime I modified my pom.xml Maven configuration file, mostly when adding or removing dependencies. Supposedly, the IDE I'm using, IntelliJ IDEA is supposed to regenerate the artifacts automatically, but for me to avoid this dependency failure I needed to remove the old artifact from the Tomcat server deployment options as well as from the project structure, and add it again.The problem here is that the test framework is using a separate server, as the documentation said. I am using the following one:I don't know how to solve the dependency issue if I am using a different server.The top error message in the exception stack says:  org.glassfish.hk2.api.UnsatisfiedDependencyException: There was no  object available for injection at SystemInjecteeImplAny ideas?Edit. I managed to patch it with a dirty solution.First, let me show you how I was injecting the DAO:The web configuration file web.xml scans the package where these classes are placed (the package has the same name than the one where the test exists) and perform the dependency injection since it finds the @Provider annotation.To patch my issue I did the exact same thing in the test class:Obviously this is a bad idea because now I have duplicate code; but it did the trick.

My assumption is that this causes the 5.5 version to take priority over the 3.6 version and dbpedia is upwards-compatible while the neo4j 5.5-version was not downwards-compatible. That might also be completely wrong since I know very little about how build paths work in terms of priority etc. and I stumbled upon this solution through luck.Anyways - it works and thats whats important to me.edit2: The proper solution was as simple as swapping the positions of dbpedia-spotlight and noe4j in the POM.",0

Then rename and replace the file name and tokens. This part works. But next when I try to build the apks using different sets of code I generated, it turns out something was wrong.Here's the gradle script I come out. The directory layout is likeThe files in folders AppOne and AppTwo are generated by Gradle copy task.When I build, I can get APKs for each product flavor. When I install apk one and apk two on a device I found that these two are are exactly the same. APK one has the exactly the same name, provider with APK two.Can somebody help me? What's wrong in my gradle scripts? or Is there other way to achieve my requirements? Thank you!",1

Trouble adding a tools dependency with Gradle for LibGDX,"I'm following along in Learn LibGDX Game Developer 2nd Edition for a class. I'm using Eclipse.

After editing, we need to refresh our dependencies. To do this,  right-click on the CanyonBunny-desktop project and go to the Refresh  All option in the Gradle menu. Make sure that you are connected to the  Internet because Eclipse will download the relevant dependencies.My build.gradle under project("":desktop"") method is the following...I also just built a dummy LibGDX project with tools enabled to make sure I was adding the code to the right section, which I was.

Gradle: Burning actual dependencies versions in release branch,"In my team we develop several applications, all use the same in-house framework. This framework is separated to many sub modules, each with its own version, and each is published as a jar to artifactory (maven repository).When we release an application we create a branch for it and we want to compile that branch against the latest release of each framework module (that's ok because in our nightly regressions we compile against the latest snapshot). We use gradle so this is done by setting the dependency version as ""latest.release"". This works great until we need to fix a bugs in production - then we release a patch for the released application by checking out the release branch, fixing the bug, compiling, validating and packaging the app.Problem: latest.release now points to a different release version than the one we originally compiled against.What I want: when releasing the app, burn all its resolved versions (the resolved latest.release) on the build.gradle (or in some other file) so when I compile it again in the future I will compile against the old releases.I assume many developers face this issue, yet I haven't found any solution for this online. I never used maven but while searching for a solution I discovered there's a plugin in maven, release plugin, that does exactly what I need.Would like to know if you have a solution for this problem.",0

Gradle seems to ignore project dependencies,"We have a multi-project build with a intra-project dependencies between the 'included' projects in the settings.gradle.  There are a number of interdependencies between the various projects expressed as project dependencies included in the moderately sized list of the project's dependencies.While this approach works fine in several other multi-project builds, in this particular project, the project dependencies are not being honored, therefore sub projects are being built in the wrong order and the build fails.So, for starters, how do we diagnose what's going on here in order to determine if it is a bug?We're running:Gradle (Wrapper) Version: 3.1Operating System: Windows 8.1 6.3 amd64JDK: Oracle 1.8.0_65So - we eventually determined that the problem was this - there was code in a  configurations.all block that was setting the useVersion on various dependencies.

Apache's HttpClient stops working when MaxPoolSize in PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager is too small,"I have a SwingWorker that gets a list of URLs (can be several hundred). In the doInBackground() method it loops through these URLs, creates each time a CloseableHttpClient, managed by a PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager, and a HttpGet. The client will then execute the httpGet and write the content (image) to a file (if possible! Not all URLs are valid and some return a 404). This works for approximately 100 requests just until the maxTotal (or the defaultMaxPerRoute) of the connectionManager is reached. Then everything stops, the client's execution stops and no Exception gets thrown.So I figured, I'd set the maxTotal and the defaultMaxPerRoute to 1000 and check it out. It works when I try downloading 1500 images, but it just feels so wrong! I want to reuse the clients instead of having 1000 of them in a pool.Socket- or ConnectionTimeouts didn't work, Debugging does not tell me what is happening and creating new HttpClients without the PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager doesn't work either. Closing the clients and/or the results does not work either. How should I manage the clients or setup the pool to make sure that my SwingWorker could even download thousands of images? I'll try to break down my SwingWorker code to the important parts:(Almost forgot, it's actually a list of objects that's looped and each object has 3 URLs)",1

Nested Boxes Algorithm - based on Nested Dolls but fundamentally different?,"I've tried to solve a problem related to the SPOJ Nested Dolls problem, where boxes with a two-dimensional bottom are used instead of dolls that differ in a single scale parameter. I have an algorithm but I'm very muddy about the actual theory behind the problem and whether better approaches exist. Can anyone help me understand the problem better and perhaps find a better algorithm?As a refresher, the Nested Dolls problem as follows:Given N Matryoshka dolls of a various sizes, find the smallest number of nested dolls that remain after optimally nesting the dolls inside one another. For each nested doll, if the outermost doll has size S then it either contains no dolls, or it contains one nested doll whose size is strictly smaller than S.I don't know the full specifics of this problem, but from reading about it I believe the Nested Dolls problem can be solved by sorting the dolls by increasing size and repeatedly extracting the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) from the size sequences, where ties are broken by choosing the subsequence that utilizes the biggest dolls. The number of nested dolls would be the number of subsequences extracted. I think this greedy algorithm works because:a) Reducing the length of one of these subsequences introduces new dolls that cannot reduce the number of nested dolls found in future steps (""fewer is better"")b) Replacing a doll in the subsequence necessarily replaces a smaller doll in the set of remaining dolls with a larger doll, which cannot reduce the number of nested dolls found in future steps (""smaller is better"")This means the problem can be solved in O(N log N) with a good LIS algorithm.But the boxes problem is different:Given N open boxes with various bottom dimensions, find the smallest number of box-stacks that remain after optimally nesting the boxes inside one another. For each box-stack, if the outermost box has dimension WxH then it either contains no boxes, or it contains one box-stack whose width and height are strictly smaller than W and H respectively.This means there is no total ordering of the boxes - if box A doesn't fit in box B, it does not imply box B has the same size as A or that it will fit in box A, unlike Matryoshka dolls.I have no idea if I'm right but I think it's no longer true that the optimal solution can be found  by repeatedly extracting the LIS (or rather, the longest sequence of boxes fitting in each other), mainly because there's no good way to break ties. A box with larger area can still end up more useful for future steps if, say, we're comparing between a 1x17 box and a 5x4 box. Trying out all the tied LIS's sounds like exponential runtime. Am I right, or is there really a greedy way to do this?I've only found one other post about this (Stacking boxes into fewest number of stacks efficiently?) which suggests using a graph theory approach to solve the problem. I have very little experience with graph theory so I have no idea how the approach works. I basically blindly took their word to make a bipartite graph of boxes, asserting that the number of box stacks = (number of boxes - size of the maximum matching). I then implemented the Fork Fulkerson algorithm in Java based on pseudocode without fully understanding how it actually solves the problem. I've tried my best to annotate the code with my thought process, but it irks me how this approach is so different from the Nested Dolls solution, and that it takes 150+ lines when I was challenged to do this in 1 hour. Is it true that there's no easier way to solve the problem?Code:",0

maven dependency conflict only in eclipse,"We have several applications as a number of modules; we've been using NetBeans. I am attempting to move the development to eclipse.All projects are built with Maven. One of them uses dbunit, and also POI. When I try to compile it in eclipse, it gives me an error for a bad method signature. Neither NetBeans build with maven nor command-line build give me this error.I discovered that the compiler was attempting to compile using a version of POI older than the one we use. The specific version of POI is designated in compile scope as a dependency for dbunit, according to dbunit's maven repository info. I don't understand why that would pull that version of POI into my compile, since I'm using dbunit, not compiling it.Nor do I understand why it gets pulled in for eclipse and not for either of the other two compilation operations.I have seen a number of comments on SO and on the eclipse bug report site about how eclipse uses one classpath only, and that it would be difficult to change and that there are no plans to change. If that's true, how are other people dealing with this?

Wrong dependencies in IntelliJ when importing project from Gradle,"I have a project with compile dependencies on Swagger which brings jackson-databind v2.4.5 and a testCompile dependency on a library that makes use of AWS SDK which brings jackson-databind v2.6.6.

When inspecting the classpath in the META-INF/MANIFEST.MF, I can see that only the smaller version jar (2.4.5) is included.This causes an exception when the tests use the AWS SDK:Because the older jackson API did not contain this method. Is this somehow preventable? I am currently using a workaround where I added the version 2.6.6 of the jackson-databind dependency in the testCompile dependencies. But I would like to avoid this, because We are not using jackson directly, it's in the gradle script just because of intellijevery time the library that is using the AWS SDK changes, I'll have to change the jackson dependency as wellNote that we use IntelliJ test runner simply because it's faster than running tests through gradle on local workstations (mainly due to incremental compilation).",0

Best approach to include JSON content in an object that will be serialised by a Jackson Mapper,"I am using Jackson Mapper object to marshal objects into JSON. It works great but sometimes I need to include some specific JSON that is not really a property of the object to be marshalled.

User roles in Java,"I am building POS system. The think is that I don't know what roles are going to be with what functionality. Here is what I have till now:I imagined that I have one main class for javafx primary stage, scene and tabpane. Also, there is each class which extends Tab class for tabPane, and all needed code for that functionality. So each tab is separate.On other hand. There is User class which is abstract with basic attributes and abstract method tasks(), and in each concrete user role ( Administrator ) class which extends this abstract class implement this method. In tasks() method I would add in List all tabs class which are needed for that user role.I want to know if this method for users role is good or bad.Acctualy I am not satisfied. The reason is open-closed OOP principle. I am not sure which users role are going to be, so I want to make it dynamic.Now, what I have in mind, is that I have only one user for start, and that is Administrator. Then, he and only he can make other user roles and save to database. User role tabs he need, administrator would add while creating user role. This way, you can return and add some new functionality to user role. There is no need to go back to code, and adding new to tasks() method. My concerne is how to implement this. What should I put in database for tasks, should I put Strings and then in some concrete class to add tasks based on string ( With lots of if statement ), or should I serialize arraylist of tasks and then save to database?",0

Spring Boot: Wrapping JSON response in dynamic parent objects,"I have a REST API specification that talks with back-end microservices, which return the following values:On ""collections"" responses (e.g. GET /users) :On ""single object"" responses (e.g. GET /users/{userUuid}) :This approach was chosen so that single responses would be extensible (for example, maybe if GET /users/{userUuid} gets an additional query parameter down the line such at ?detailedView=true we would have additional request information).Fundamentally, I think it is an OK approach for minimizing breaking changes between API updates. However, translating this model to code is proving very arduous.Let's say that for single responses, I have the following API model object for a single user:The advantage of this method is that we can expose only the fields from the internally used models for which we have public getters, but not others. Then, for collections responses I would have the following wrapper class:For single object responses, we would have the following:This yields JSON responses which are formatted as per the API specification at the top of this post. The upside of this approach is that we only expose those fields that we want to expose. The heavy downside is that I have a ton of wrapper classes flying around that perform no discernible logical task aside from being read by Jackson to yield a correctly formatted response.My questions are the following:How can I possibly generalize this approach? Ideally, I would like to have a single BaseSingularResponse class (and maybe a BaseCollectionsResponse extends ResourceSupport class) that all my models can extend, but seeing how Jackson seems to derive the JSON keys from the object definitions, I would have to user something like Javaassist to add fields to the base response classes at Runtime - a dirty hack that I would like to stay as far away from as humanly possible.Is there an easier way to accomplish this? Unfortunately, I may have a variable number of top-level JSON objects in the response a year from now, so I cannot use something like Jackson's SerializationConfig.Feature.WRAP_ROOT_VALUE because that wraps everything into a single root-level object (as far as I am aware).Is there perhaps something like @JsonProperty for class-level (as opposed to just method and field level)?",1

How can I explicitly signal completion of a Flowable in RxJava?,I'm trying to create a Flowable which is wrapping an Iterable. I push elements to my Iterable periodically but it seems that the completion event is implicit. I don't know how to signal that processing is complete. For example in my code:This prints:  1  2  3  4  completedI checked the source of the Flowable interface but it seems that I can't signal that a Flowable is complete explicitly. How can I do so? In my program I publish events which have some delay between them and I would like to be explicit when to complete the event flow.Clarification:I have a long running process which emits events. I gather them in a queue and I expose a method which returns a Flowable which wraps around my queue. The problem is that there might be already elements in the queue when I create the Flowable. I will process the events only once and I know when the flow of events stops so I know when I need to complete the Flowable.,1

Android Studio firebase database wait for read before adding new values,"I have a database in which I store users and I want to check if a user exists before adding a new one so I don't overwrite.

Maven multiple definitions in dependencyManagement - especially with import,How does Maven handle multiple definitions of a dependency in the dependencyManagement section of pom.xml? e.g.Here I've defined spring-context twice. Once with an exclusion and once without. Maven runs and builds with both entries present. But I'm not certain how it 'reads' the dependency. Sensible behavior may be for it to merge the definitions.

How are dependency binaries included in my final built and installed .JAR in Maven?,"1) I included a Spring Context dependency in my pom.xml project in Eclipse with Maven. 2) I ran the 'Install' phase on the project and it built properly, and the project was installed to my local .m2 repository 3) When I unzipped my .JAR, I only saw my single class that I created custom.This brings up two questions:1) Are external, dependency classes only included in your final built jars if a class from it is physically instantiated within your class?and 2) How come, when I imported the SpringContextAnnotationConfig class into my class, and instantiated an instance of it, and installed my project, I STILL only saw my custom class when I unzipped my .JAR.

How to exclude a direct dependency of a Maven Plugin,"I want to exclude a direct dependency of a Maven plugin and the approach described in [ does not work (as indicated by this comment](""https://stackoverflow.com/q/6028534/2525313"">this)).As a particular example:I still see javax.xml.bind:jaxb-api in the list of dependencies (with mvn ... -X). What am I doing wrong?(In case someone has an idea for how to replace the dependency on that artifact with the JDK 9 equivalent for that API [as seems to happen on Java 8, where ""JAXB API os loaded from the [jar:...jre/lib/rt.jar]""], I'm happy to open a new issue for that.)UpdateRunning out of ideas and this being an experiment anyways, I excluded the dependency by editing the plugin's pom.xml in my local repository. Now mvn ... -X shows that there is also an indirect dependency (in this case by org.jvnet.jaxb2.maven2:maven-jaxb22-plugin) that I can successfully exclude with the mechanism above. Just using both excludes, from maven-jaxb2-plugin and maven-jaxb22-plugin, does not do the trick. This indicates that exclusion works in general but apparently not on a plugin's direct dependency.(By the way, this indeed lead to ""Java JAXB API is loaded from the [jrt:/java.xml.bind]"", which was my goal.)",0

Eclipse import dependencies that are declared in a Maven Profile,"TL;DRI must declare some dependencies in a Maven profile and Eclipse is not able to resolve the packages. Example in the image below. Full storyHi to everyone :DRight now I'm working in a very fishy project situation. I'm developing a Spring Web MVC based web application and I'm using Google AppEngine DevServer for local development, even tho I'm seriously thinking about migrating from GAE for more than obvious reasons.The reason why the project is GAE based is because I'm simply continuing the job someone else started time ago.Anyways, while developing and increasing the app functionality it came the time where persitence engine became a need. I decided to implement MongoDB and yes, I'm aware that you can't use any other thing rather than Datastore in GAE environment. As persistence layer I'm using MongoRepository. Until now everything is ok.Problems came when testing time arrived. In order to implement intergration tests I used an in-memory db, [Fake Mongo Fongo](""https://github.com/fakemongo/fongo"") in addition to [NoSQLUnit](""https://github.com/lordofthejars/nosql-unit"") for data populating. The main problem is Fongo requires mongo java driver in order to work and I can't declare it,nor any other JDBC dependency, because GAE DevServer won't work. I don't use java-mongo-driver anyware in my app rather than indirectly via Fongo in integration tests.The solution is to simply skip all test source compilation and declare them in a separate Maven so everytime I want to deploy on the local server I simply skip all tests. That's not a problem because I'm using Jenkins for CI and SonarQube for coverage (with JaCoCo) so I can simply execute tests there.Right now I have my pom.xml with all the app dependencies in the general  section so I can mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true and then I have a  declared as follows:So I can mvn clean test -Ptesting whenever Jenkins detects a push.The problem is I can not write code in Eclipse because it does not resolve the imports since they're declared in a profile. E.g.[](""https://i.stack.imgur.com/snOGn.png"")How can I import and work with the packages that I declared in a Maven profile?Thank you :)P.S.: I decided to tell the full story so maybe someone else who is or will be going thru the same problem can find it.

Is it possible to avoid compile-time dependency using spring Java @Configuration?,"Is there a way to declare beans using spring Java based configuration without compile-time checking, so that I can provide interface implementation at runtime? For example, when I write a JAX-RS client, I use the JAX-RS API without referring to a specific API implementation. In my spring XML configuration, I then declare the actual implementation of the JAX-RS API that I want to use, e.g. Jersey, when setting up the client bean. Because XML based configuration is used (and verified) during runtime, I do not need compile time dependency to Jersey. This allows me to have a runtime Maven dependency to Jersey, while I must have a compile dependency to the JAX-RS API. The benefit of this approach is that if I accidentally use the implementation, my application won't compile with Maven. On the other hand, if I use the Java based spring configuration (using @Configuration) to declare my beans, I must have a compile time dependency to the implementation of the API because the configuration itself is compiled. If this is not possible to achieve with Java based configuration, are there any alternatives (besides using a combination of XML and Java based configuration which I know is possible)?",0

Internal dependencies class qualified name conflict,"There are two dependency libraries in my Gradle project: OLD: full util libNEW: only db lib (fixed lib)which both holds same db connection classes including package eg.: net.mycompany.common.dbsq.DBConnector().What I need is to ensure use of db connection classes from NEW, but keeping OLD (can be without db classes) as dependency due to rest of needed utils, that are not available in NEW.

I want to use OpenCV inside an Application called Max/MSP. To give an idea, it looks like this :[](""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yejN0.png"")Max/MSP allows user to assemble Patch by cabling some objects together that are called externals, most of them are coded in C but you can also create externals in Java. To do so you need to instantiate them through an object called ""mxj"". For example, if my Java class is called TestOpenCV, I will create a box and put ""mxj TestOpenCV"" inside.OpenCV seems correctly implemented, for exemple, I can instantiate a Mat object and post its content to Max console. Problems appears when I change the Java code of the mxj object. To update my object, I delete it and recreate it again. Then, the same issue that explained [](""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36936948/java-lang-unsatisfiedlinkerror-native-library-xxx-so-already-loaded-in-another"">here)Max console return this error message :   java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Native Library  C:\Windows\System32\opencv_java300.dll already loaded in another  classloader   at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary1(Unknown Source)   at  java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary0(Unknown Source)    at  java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary(Unknown Source)     at  java.lang.Runtime.loadLibrary0(Unknown Source)    at  java.lang.System.loadLibrary(Unknown Source)  at  OpenCVClassLoad.loadNativeLibrary(OpenCVClassLoad.java:5)     at  TestOpenCV.(TestOpenCV.java:22) (mxj) unable to alloc instance  of TestOpenCVWhat I triedI tried to implement the answer of user2543253. He advices to create a tiny classes that import the native library and export it as a JAR. So I created a new Eclipse project added a source file to itI added the openCV JAR to that project and exported it as a JAR. Then I changed my code according to what user2543253 explained (there is more code,I kept the essential) : Of course, but that's a bit weird, in order to build correctly that project I kept the JAR from OpenCV in the build path : [](""https://i.stack.imgur.com/RTvUn.png"")As you can see, I also added the tiny class in the project build path. After all of theses modifications, the mxj object stille loads correctly the first time and the bang() method still works but the problem still there.

A workaround should be to simply reuse that library already loaded, no ? but how to achieve this ? Because if I check the library has already being loaded, I do it using a Try / Catch, if I do nothing else. The externals acts like if the library had never been loaded...

"Android-Studio: How to update a chat (ListView) from a thread, which is startet in an other Activity","Hey guys:) I'm currently working on an android project, where I want to realize a chat function. I know there are several tutorials which describe a chat app but I want to do it myself with my own Server.In my MainActivity I start a self written updater in a new thread (bc. of network-operations can only be done outside the UI thread), which permanently checks, if the chat-protocol, which is stored on my server (RaspberryPi), has new messages from other users. If there are new messages, the Updater downloads it and stores it in a string. This works fine!Now, when the updater receives a new message, I want to update the ListView in my Chat-Activity with the new message. This process should work at any time and update my ListView permanently (not with a refresh button or sth. like that).My question is: how do i realize this the smoothest way - a strategy, not necessarily code. One idea, which works but feels a bit random, is to write the received messages in a shared preferences-file and load it in the chat-acivity via an infinite loop in the chat activity.Is there a possibility to write the received messages directly in the ListView at any time from the thread with the updater which was startet in the MainActivity.If needed i could upload the current code but i want to do it directly and not with an infinite loop.Thanks for reading and maybe even for the help :)",1

Java 9 automatic module dependencies cannot be resolved / module not found,"I'm trying to migrate some legacy applications to the new Java 9 module system, to strengthen its encapsulation.I'm starting from the outside-in, with the assumption that classes on the periphery will have the least external dependencies.As you'd expect, I've declared a very open module to start with:This instantly breaks the entire project (inside all classes), when suddenly every import for an external dependency no longer resolves (causing over 1k Java problems):   The import com.otherexample cannot be resolved     The import org.springframework cannot be resolved    etc.Local packages in the same project com.example.price still work - as do java.util etc.All of the external dependencies are (were) managed with Maven.

"How to inject non static, on demand NativeModules into React Native Android?","In a hybrid app where multiple Activity/Fragment instances nesting their own ReactRootViews share a single ReactInstanceManager instance, there seems to be no official way to inject a native module per Activity/Fragment instance. By nature, native modules are singleton like javascript modules residing in a .js file. This is not the intended behavior if JS code running inside different instances of the same Fragment wants to access Java/Kotlin side to interact with the local properties of the Fragment.I tried using registerAdditionalPackages() method of ReactInstanceManager but it fails with an assertion error like below if used simultaneously by multiple Fragments/Activitys. ""Extending native modules with non-matching application contexts.""It wasn't a thread safety issue but a design consequence of registerAdditionalPackages() implementation. Is there another way, and if so, how do you access the injected module on the JS side?",1

Cannot get card/deck object program to work,"this is my first time posting on the forum and I'm not entirely sure if my question is valid, but I will try to be specific and follow the guideline. In following the guidelines, this is a question based around a class assignment. This assignment is to take code that creates a 'deck' object that represents a deck of cards and add several features. I am currently stuck in the process.My issue lies within this code: }The majority of this program was already provided with the assignment, but we are to add several features. The first of these features was a shuffle method, which I was able to do. In the next feature we are to create a 'Hand' class that deals a hand of cards to the user and calculate how many points they have, as if it were a game of blackjack.This is the exact wording of this step is: 'Add a Hand Class that contains an array of 5 Card references. Have the program Deal the Hand two cards and display them for the user. Tell the user how many points they have and ask them if they would like another card or not.  Continue to allow the player to add cards until they reach 5 cards or the total is greater than 21.'I have ran through several ways that I felt I could create this class, but none seem to be working. This current iteration is as close as I've gotten. I am currently stumped, however. My issues are; I don't know why I'm getting the type error when I try to use the Hand class and I have no idea how to implement the getPoints() method.

There are also plenty of other parameters, I know. The problems with these parameters are:They aren't relevant. I don't want to limit the heap size to 6GB (and trust that native memory won't take more than 2GB). I do want to limit all the memory (heap, native, whatever).

My high-level expectation is: since there is only 8GB, and some static memory is needed - take the static memory from the 8GB, and carefully split the remaining memory between other dynamic memory entities.Also, ulimit and similar things don't work. I don't want to kill the java process once it consumes more memory than expected.

"How can Netbeans run my application when some of my application's dependencies are not in the ""Libraries"" folder?","I have an application what works properly when I run it from Netbeans, but doesn't work properly when I run it from the executable jar produced by the Netbeans ""Clean and Build"" command.

I know that ClassNotFoundException is thrown when the given class isn't in the classpath of the application.

Resize a JLayeredPane based on user's input,"I'm developping a sprite editor. I have a class that extends JPanel, in that class, I use a JLayeredPane as a container.

Eclipse AST parser not preserving static import,"I pray that you are well.I am trying to write a QuickFix plugin in Eclipse for ""not found"" imports. As part of this, I am trying to generate an AST with a variety of different import statement types. I am trying to avoid setting up a full-blown Eclipse workspace to perform the test.The code to fire up the parser and produce an AST is pretty simple. However, I have found that the parser does not honour the ""static"" keyword on the imports. So if I find an ImportDeclaration on the generated AST, its isStatic() property will be false even if the source contained ""import static ..."", and if I dump the contents of the CompilationUnit I can see that the ""static"" keyword has been dropped.I tried to get around this problem by generating the AST directly instead of via the parser. I can then call ""setStatic(true)"" on the ImportDeclaration to set its static flag. This generates the correct structure:However, dec.getStartPosition() is set to -1 and dec.getLength() returns 0, presumably as they don't correspond to any particular source. This messes up my QuickFix processor, which needs to know where in the source they appear to work. I can try and manually set all of the set and end positions, but I was kinda hoping that's what the parser should be doing.Any suggestions? Is it a simple parser configuration option that I'm missing?",0

Expand animation of a row in ListView,I have a ListView with restaurants. Each row has an expand button which lets you see the restaurant's menu. I'm trying to add a smooth expand animation. So far I've got something like this:It is smooother than actually changing height with something like ValueAnimator (which is what I tried before).My problem is that this animates only the row whose menu is expanding. I would like to animate also the visible rows below the row with expanding menu to achieve better visual effect. I tried to get them from the ListView with ListView.getChildAt() and apply similar TranslateAnimation on them but this doesn't work if the menu is too long. I believe this happens due to the View being recycled by my ListView so is there any workaround?,1

Is it possible to check which gradle dependencies contains given class?,Recently we had a version mismatch problem with a class org.apache.commons.beanutils.PropertyUtilsBean. We thought that mismatch is just between some dependency that brings commons-beanutils in versions 1.8 and 1.9.3 but after tracking and excluding each transitive dependency we were still facing an issue.It turns out that the the PropertyUtilsBean was also packed inside the commons-digester3-3.2-with-deps instead declared as dependency to commons-beanutils.Is it possible in gradle to search all dependencies (including transitive ones) for specific fully qualified classname?

Can Java's XMLEncoder serialize objects that have non-serializable fields?,"I am really confused by all the opinions I find in books and even here so bear with me please!It is stated in Clay Richardson's Professional Java JDK 6 that  you will notice that MyBean does not implement Serializable.   XMLEncoder/Decoder does not require classes it serializes to implement   Serializable.and that  the XMLEncoder/Decoder API serializes object  instances without any knowledge of their private data members. It serializes based upon the object’s  methods, its JavaBean properties, exposed through the JavaBeans convention > of getters and setters (getXXX and setXXX).Doesn't that mean that XMLEncoder can serialize non-serializable objects such as a javafx.scence.color if it is a field inside a JavaBean ? Well I tried to create a JavaBean and followed all the stated conventions about the naming and the default no-arg constructor as followswhere Shape is an abstract class implementing IShape interface as shown belownow if I run this main method to testI get this errorThe interesting part is that if I use serializable classes such as java.awt.Color, the code works fine and the XML is generated.

Maven - How to use different version dependency in two projects that depend on each other,"General Description:I have two projects A and B.Project A, must use the version v1 of the L library/API.Project B, must use the version v2 of the L library/API.Project A has a dependency on project B (In project A, i need to call a method contained in B).Concrete description:Project A is actually a machine learner which has a collection of algorithms which are using  an older version of spark-mllib.I want to integrate the XGBOOST-spark algorithm in project A.The problem is that the XGBOOST api, specifically: ml.dmlc.xgboost4j.scala.spark.XGBoost.train() method, expects an RDD. But the org.apache.spark.ml.feature.LabeledPoint is only available in the newer version of spark-mllib. And from project A (which uses the older version of spark-mllib), I only have acces to an org.apache.spark.mllib.regression.LabeledPoint. So I cannot directly integrate XGBOOST in project A without upgrading the spark-mllib version of project A.Fortunately, the newer version of spark-mllib has a method of converting from the old LabeledPoint (org.apache.spark.mllib.regression.LabeledPoint) to the new LabeledPoint (org.apache.spark.ml.feature.LabeledPoint). The method is: org.apache.spark.mllib.regression.LabeledPoint.asML().So, the question is: Is there any clever way of using that method .asML() which is available only in the newer version of spark, so that I can convert the LabeledPoint and pass it to the XGBOOST API?I am not familiar with how the dependencies are treated by maven but I thought of something like:Create a project B that uses the newer version of spark-mllib, and the XGBOOST-API, and in which we have a class and a method that receives the parameters (from project A), converts the old LabeledPoint to the new LabeledPoint, calls the XGBoost.train() method which generates a model, and then we pass back the model to project A. We import that class in project A (from project B), call it's method, get the model, and we continue with our business as usual.Of course, I tried to do that. But it doesn't work. I think that's because of the fact that we can only have one version of spark-mllib in the whole dependency tree. Since the class from project B throws java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.spark.mllib.regression.LabeledPoint.asML()Lorg/apache/spark/ml/feature/LabeledPoint; , it seems that in the whole dependency tree, we actually use the older version of spark-mllib (and that happens because the older version is closer to the root of the dependency tree). Even though in project B we use the newer version of spark-mllib, which has the asML() method available.So, the actual question is: Is there any clever way of making this work? Without upgrading the spark-mllib version on project A? Upgrading is not a viable option. Project A is big and if I upgrade that version, I screw up just about everything.[Update]I even tried to use a ClassLoader (URLClassLoader) in order to load the class directly from spark-mllib_2.11-2.3.0.jar and print all the available methods. Code here:In my .pom file of this project, if I add a dependency of:The method public org.apache.spark.ml.feature.LabeledPoint org.apache.spark.mllib.regression.LabeledPoint.asML() is present the results if i use the 2.3.0 version.But when I use the version 1.6.2 of spark-mllib, it isn't there anymore.Even though the asML() method is within the spark-mllib's jar. Which is kind of weird.",0

Efficient algorithm for word creation in java,"I'm developing a word game using the libGDX framework, and I want to implement a basic Hint feature whereby the system can generate a valid 7 letter word from the 17 letters provided on a board. Now, the setup of the 17 letters (to pick from) on board is completely random and so I cannot use pre-determined hint words for hints (like in 4 pics 1 word). My solution was to do a little bit of combination by finding every possible 7 letter combination from the 17 letters provided. Next up, I permuted each of the combinations and cross checked them with a wordSet English Lexicon and the first valid word I obtain would be the hint word. As you've already guessed, this process is tasking knowing that 17 Permutation 7 is already equals to 98 million possible permutations. To cover up for this, I used a FixedThreadPool to split the permutation tasks (into about 20 worker threads), and I now have a relatively fast word search, but the downside is, this causes serious lag in lower end devices.Any suggestions on how to make a better hint word search algorithm or improve my method explained above would be appreciated.",1

What is the relation or difference between adding javax-servlet dependency in pom.xml and setting Dynamic web module in project facets?,"I have read eclipse documentation on project facets as:   Facets define characteristics and requirements for Java EE projects and are used as part of the runtime configuration.When you add a facet to a project, that project is configured to perform a certain task, fulfill certain requirements, or have certain characteristics.And about maven dependencies as:Maven is a powerful project management tool that is based on POM (project object model). It is used for projects build, dependency and documentation.My question is when I select Dynamic web module in eclipse as project facets then it adds support for Java servlet API, for generation of Web Page Content then why do I need to add javax.servlet-api dependency in pom.xml in eclipse?I have read different answers on how to enable Dynamic web module in project facets but none could solve my query.

Why are my Alexa Skills Kit dependencies missing?,"I cloned Amazon's ASK java repository on github and ran     mvn packageon it, and it produced the following .jars:I noticed that when attempting to make certain imports for classes on [https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills](""https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills""), such as  import com.amazon.speech.speechlet.servlet.SpeechServlet; I received a message stating that com.amazon.speech could not be resolved, indicating that the file didn't exist. However, after further investigation, I noticed that there was a SkillServlet class that seemed to essentially replace the SpeechServlet class as it was able to do everything that SpeechServlet could, so I assumed that the developer site hadn't been updated yet to reflect the changes.

I think this means that maven has failed, so I just downloaded the jar directly from mvnrepository.com. Any idea why this might have happened?",0

Is there any automated way to update and manage Java/Scala dependencies with Gradle?,"I've recently returned to working on a Scala project, after having spent some time working with the nodejs ecosystem. After getting used to package managers like npm and yarn, I feel like I need to rethink the tools/processes I've been using for Java/Scala. With that in mind, there are several problems which appear to exist in the JVM world for which I'd like to know if there's some automated solution:Given some list of dependencies without versions (but with group, module), is there some automated way to detect what the valid combinations (if any exist) of versions for each dependency are? Specifically, ensuring that there are no conflicting transitive dependencies?I believe Java Modules should reduce/eliminate this issue, but I'm currently limited to Java 8 so can't use them.Aside from manually changing version numbers in my build.gradle, is there any automated way to update a dependency from cli?For example, I can do yarn install @ to record the new version of a nodejs library I depend on and install it in one step - does anything similar exist for JVM projects?Are there any tools similar to [updtr](""https://www.npmjs.com/package/updtr"") for Java/Scala projects? Basically; a tool that will automatically try to update my dependencies and run tests with the new versions, and rollback if anything fails.In case it matters, I'm currently using gradle as my build tool in a Scala 2.11 project; but I'm curious to know about any answers that would apply to any mixed language project using any build tool.

Accessing the remote class method to resolve cyclic dependency,"[](""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xu661.png"")I am working with multimodule maven project, where I am facing the cyclic dependency between the driver(module A) and actors(module B)   Actors module has a common creation of actor system which should be  common for all the actors across the projectdriver uses ActorSystem to create an ActorRef  for some client-side API calls hence there is a dependency of Module B on Module A.Also Actor A calls the method of driver class, which needs the dependency of Module A on Module B.  So it turns out to be cyclic dependency where Module A needs Module B  and vice versaI was looking for the solution where I could eliminate the dependency of Module A on B, as I want the Module B should not be dependent on any module.If there can be any way by which I could access the method in the driver class indirectly that could help in eliminating the cause of cyclic dependency.

how to play an ObjectAnimator sequentially with a playTogether,This may be a dumb question but I'm not quite sure how to go about playing an ObjectAnimator and then two other ObjectAnimators who should be played together in sequential order.I have an image that I'm trying to rotate and then move diagonally. In order to move the image diagonally I made an AnimatorSet and am playing the two ObjectAnimators together (one for the x direction and another for the y direction).

"How can I make some class, running in the Main Thread, await concurrently for other class to reach some specific state?","I am having serious difficulties to understand how can I make some AsyncTask children, declared and instantiated in the Main Thread, to await for a Service child instance to reach some specific state.As code examples here is the relevant part for Service; this code does what expected: receives the JSON response and holds it.This Service works; fine. Then, from another class (which purpose will be to handle persistence inserting the received data in a local Room Database), I try to do the following (here's where my mind is blown):Summarizing: my problem is that I will always get NullReferenceException in this line:I am not familiar with multithreading, asyncronous operations and concurrent execution. I have been reading, for two   weeks, lots of different documents on the Internet both from Android Official Website and from other websites as well, trying to figure it out... ""AsyncTask is not good to perform this kind of operations""... so, what infrastructure should I implement, I have been wondering... should I use Handlers, Threads, Messengers, or what? The more I read, the more confused I get. It's like I have an [Analysis Paralysis](""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis"") issue...Most of the examples I find out there provide too verbose code examples on how to implement multithreading and concurrent execution; while I read them and try to figure out how to implement those structures in my code, I just get stuck; also, with so many classes to choose, I get even more confused...Due to the HTTP call will need to be performed asyncronously (and response time will not always be   the same), I am trying to figure out how to make the piece of code that throws the NullReferenceException ""wait"" for MyService to complete it's job before starting it's execution; while loops will not work due to it would break Main Thread's lifecycle. ""Knowing"" if the Service completed it's task or not would be as simple as using the boolean method responseReceived. The big idea is, every time new data is obtained through HTTP, updating the RoomDatabase with it, and, meanwhile, MainActivity would be showing the current local data (if any, or an empty list if there's nothing yet).So, when I get it, I will understand how to refactor the whole code structure properly to start adding more Service child instances into my RemoteDataSource class, which I created with the idea of having all Service childs that will use OkHttp to perform HTTP communications, wrapped together in a single class for better organization.What would be the proper way to achieve what I am looking for about this? Would someone be able to provide some short example explaining the code structure I will need for something like this? Examples with empty blocks containing comments like ""code to execute when ready here"" would be great so I can figure it out.The question exposed here is related with the same project that made me post [ some weeks ago; I have been reading here and there, performing some trial-and-error and correcting some code issues here-and-there since then; however, I am making a different question here; finding an answer for this would probably be the first step towards figuring out an answer to the other question as well.URL References to documentation I have been readingSome of the documentation I have been reading (but not limited to):AsyncTask class documentation](""https://stackoverflow.com/q/52202101/3692177"">this)[Handler class documentation](""https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Handler"")[Basics on Multithreading](""https://developer.samsung.com/galaxy/others/multithreading-in-android"")[Introduction to background processing in Android - Tutorial](""http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/AndroidBackgroundProcessing/article.html"")[Thread With Handlers - Android Example](""https://androidexample.com/Thread_With_Handlers_-_Android_Example/index.php?view=article_discription&amp;aid=58&amp;aaid=83"")[Messenger class documentation](""https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Messenger"")",1

So I also added both the intermediate and root certs from Digicert into the truststore (not the keystore) but that does not work.However, if I cat the intermediate and root certs and use them in an openssl connection from the client to the server it successfully connects, which leads me to believe it's something to do with the java truststore.Edit: I'm calling the connection in java with the following:Example: java -Djavax.net.debug=ssl,handshake -jar myjar.jar myserver.mydomain.com User truststore.jks  mykeystore.jks ",1

How do I import java.sql.* using JDK 10.0.2 and Eclipse?,"I am relatively new to Java programming and the class I am taking is introducing me to MySQL right now. I am using JDK 10.0.2 and my class has instructions for JDK 1.7 or 1.8. I have just downloaded the MySQL Connector file, extracted it, and have the ""mysql-connector-java-8.0.12.jar"" file sitting in a temp folder on my desktop. My instructor wants me to copy said file to ""JAVA_HOME\jre\lib\ext"". However I understand via here that as of JDK 9 and up they have removed the extension mechanism and I am supposed to make an individual classpath for each project using this connector. At this stage I am trying to import java.sql.* into my eclipse project and am getting ""The import java.sql cannot be resolved"" as an error.How do I properly set up the .jar file and its classpath using JDK 10.0.2 in my project in order to import java.sql.* and proceed?As a side note, I don't know much about ""Maven"" but I am trying to do this manually without involving ""Maven"". Again, I am using Eclipse as the IDE.",0

"Spring Boot, Gradle and non-Maven dependencies","Java 8, Spring Boot 1.5.8 and Gradle 4.6 here.I'm building a Spring Boot app and use the built-in Gradle tasks to produce a self-contained, executable ""fat"" jar for it. Another team has generated a dependency JAR that I need to incorporate into my project.In a few months we will have a binary repository set up that they will publish new versions of their library to, and that I will resolve/pull from. But for right now, I'm stuck with the somewhat draconian distribution model where they email me a version and I need to figure out how to get it working with Gradle to get it on the classpath.So...My project lives on my machine at /home/myuser/workspace/my-spring-boot-app. They have emailed me the first version of their library, say, some-lib-0.1.0.jar and I have downloaded it to, say, /home/myuser/some-lib-0.1.0.jar).Another complicating (and important!) factor is that this JAR has no pom.xml file with it (yet). They simply included, in their email, a list of all its dependencies which I have already included in my app's build.gradle file. So I don't think this JAR's dependencies will be a problem, but wanted you all to be aware that there is no pom.xml for it, so not sure if that means I need to write my own, etc...I'm imagining that the simplest solution here is to install/import the library into my local Maven/Gradle repository (wherever mavenLocal() resolves from)? And that once its imported/installed there, I can just add mavenLocal() to my list of repositories { ... } and add it as a compile dependency, right?If so, how do I accomplish the first part (getting it into mavenLocal() without a POM)?

java - How to stop handle leaks for many simultaneous threads,"I've run into an apparent handle leak, but I'm hoping there's a workaround or that I'm just misunderstanding how the JRE handles Threads internally. Please note that the answer to this question is NOT ""use thread pools and limit the maximum number of simultaneous threads."" That doesn't address the underlying problem or possible solutions, especially if a very large number of maximum simultaneous threads is desirable.If I create and start many threads at once a lot of handles are allocated. This makes perfect sense. However, when those threads all end, most of the allocated handles aren't released. Handle counts from Process Explorer are given below for:Peak - Maximum handle count after 600 threads are created and runningThreads Ended - Handle count after all 600 threads have ended (just leaving the main thread and JVM threads) Two major observations here:JRE 5 and later have substantially higher handle overhead for threads than 1.4JRE 6 and later aren't freeing up handles after threads endCreating and starting the same or fewer number number of threads repeatedly does not increase the Peak/Ended handle counts (except when using JRE 1.5 which may have another slower leak). Increasing the number of maximum simultaneous threads increases both numbers.All JREs used for testing are of the Sun/Oracle variety.GC never comes along and cleans up the mess based on a few days of testing and observing the problem. Does anybody know how to ensure that the handle resources for Threads are released after use in Java 6 and later without restarting the JVM?Test code to reproduce the problem is below:",1

How to import from maven public repo to Talend data integration for tJava to use?,"I am new to Talend so this may be a basic question.

Edit SQLite data when clicking textview,"I want to update data from an SQLite database by clicking on a dynamically created textview.

"How to build same source code twice with different dependency version, in both Maven and Eclipse?","I would like to build two different versions of a custom SonarQube (SQ) plugin; one for SonarQube 6.7.x LTS release, one for the latest 7.6 release. At the moment, I have a Maven structure similar to the following:parentcommon: Common code used by both tool and both plugin versions, doesn't use SQ APItool: Some related command-line utility, doesn't use SQ APIplugin-6.7: Plugin code for SQ 6.7plugin-7.6: Plugin code for SQ 7.6dist: Builds a distribution zip containing the CLI utility, both plugin versions, dependency licenses and source codeMost of the source code and resources are the same for both plugin-6.7 and 7.6; only a small number of classes are different. As such I would like to move this common code to some shared source folder/module. I would still like to compile this common code twice though, to verify the code compiles against both SQ API versions. In Eclipse this should show up as two separate source folders or projects, so I can easily verify that the common code doesn't use any SQ API's that are not yet available in 6.7 API, and doesn't use any API's that have been removed or deprecated in 7.6 API.Preferably I would like to stick with building both plugin versions in a single build, so if possible I would like to avoid having to use two separate profiles.Is this possible in any way?What I have triedWith Maven I have found several ways for getting this to work, but I cannot get any of these approaches to work with m2eclipse.Approach 1Create a new module plugin-common, containing pom-6.7.xml and pom-7.6.xml. Both pom's are essentially the same apart from artifact id or classifier, and dependency on different SQ API version. Parent project defines these as 2 separate modules using The issue with this approach is that I can't import these modules into Eclipse, as m2eclipse only supports pom.xml as the filename.Approach 2Similar to the above, but using separate sub-directories for the pom.xml files and using ${project.basedir}/../src/main/java to point to the common source code:plugin-commonsrc/main/javasrc/main/resourcespom.xml: parent for 6.7 and 7.6 modules6.7/pom.xml7.6/pom.xmlThis approach allows for importing both plugin-common versions into Eclipse, but Eclipse complains about 'Access .../src/main/java directory outside of project base directory'. As such it doesn't show any source code in the two plugin-common projects.Approach 3Don't have any pom.xml files in plugin-common, but instead add the common code as source folders to both plugin-6.7 and plugin-7.6 modules using build-helper-maven-plugin, using ${project.basedir}/../plugin-common/src/main/java.Again this fails in Eclipse due to the 'Access .../src/main/java directory outside of project base directory' warning.",0

MyService should have Foo injected ''before'' Foo's init() method is called, but it doesn't seem to be the case when I build and run it on the new computer. My guess is that somehow a different version of spring is being used, where the rules for dependency injection are somehow different.",0

Shapes disappear when I change camera settings,"flow-ers! I'm learning a fascinating language: Processing. I started to use P3D and tried to make 'First-person' camera in 3D world. The matter is, when I move my mouse(means I changed my camera option), 3D shapes such as spheres and cubes seem to be cut by a transparent plane. I made some attempts to deal with my problem, (e.g. changing 3rd factor of camera()) but it still doesn't work. Let me show my codes.This is the main drawing part of my program.and this is locating function of the shapes.finally, this is what I wrote for P.view():I expect the ""normal view"" as in real world, but when I look at some shapes squarely, they disappear! They only seem normally when I leer at them, and the sculpture steadily fades away when I move my sight to them; more specifically, it it looks like it was cut by a plane. Please help me solving this problem. (Or is there any mis-coding in my codes?)",1

How can i prevent recyclerview scrolling to start when i load more data,"I am trying to build a news feed using cardviews listed in a recyclerview. Problem is, when I load more data by scrolling, it is automatically scrolling to top of page.

So let's say that I loaded 4 news at beginning, then I scrolled to bottom of page and loaded 4 more news. Its just adding new data to Arraylist and kind of re-creating recyclerview.
