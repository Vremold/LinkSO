SWT Link flickers with gradient background,"I'm developing a an eclipse plugin that uses an SWT interface.  I need to display text, and within that text there needs to be links.  The only two widgets that I've found that will allow me to include clickable links in text are Link and Browser.  Browser, however, is overkill for my needs, and I couldn't properly customize the look of it.  This only leaves the Link widget.The problem is I need the Link widget to inherit a gradient from the Composite in which it is in.  It does this correctly, only when it is resized or scrolled the Link component flickers.  The Link is the only component in which I have seen this effect.In an attempt to fix this I've tried manipulating other components into having clickable links, but I haven't found a good solution yet.Is there anyway to fix the flickering effect on the Link, or is there a different component which would support links?Thanks,Brian",0
How does the Sun JVM map Java threads to Windows threads?,"My application uses loads of Java threads. I am looking for a reliable understanding how the JVM (version 5 and 6) maps the Java threads to underlying Windows threads. I know there is a document for mapping to Solaris threads, but not Windows.Why doesn't Sun publish this information?I want to know if there's a 1:1 mapping, or if it varies by JVM, by -server option, by workload, etc, etc.I know I am not ""supposed"" to care, I should write properly synchronisd code, but I am inheriting a large body of code...Also, does anyone know how to give names to Windows threads?",0

Invoking Java main method with parameters from Eclipse,"During development (and for debugging) it is very useful to run a Java class' public static void main(String[] argv)  method directly from inside Eclipse (using the Run As context menu).Is there a similarily quick way to specify command line parameters for the run?What I do now is go to the ""Run Dialog"", click through the various settings to the tab where I can specify VM and program arguments and enter them there. Too many steps, plus I do not want to mix the more permanent runtime configuration settings with the one-off invokation parameters.What I want instead is to check a box somewhere (or have a separate menu item ""Run as Java application with command line"") and then be prompted for the commandline every time (with a nice history).",0

How can I visualize jar (not plugin) dependencies?,"I am currently refactoring a large Java application. I have split up one of the central (Eclipse) projects into about 30 individual ""components"", however they are still heavily inter-dependent. In order to get a better idea of what depends on what I am looking for some way to graph the compile time dependencies.All tools I have found so far are capable of graphing package or class dependencies or the dependencies between Eclipse plugins, however what I have in mind should just take a look at the classpath settings for each Eclipse project and build a coarser grained graph from that.Later I will then go deeper, however right now this would just mean I would not be able to see the forest for all of the trees.",0

"With Hibernate, can I mix table-per-subclass and a <map> within the same table?","I'm attempting to map an object model for ""Promotions""; i.e., a customer enters a promo code during signup. Different promo codes might have different types of ""benefits"", meaning what we are giving to the customer. For example: promo code XYZ123 will give the customer free minutes in his or her account, while a different promo code will offer various discounts off of the various subscription plans that the user can choose from when signing up.In my domain model, I've modeled the different types of benefits as subclasses with an abstract superclass which has the common properties. I've chosen to model the different types as subclasses since some types of benefits will need different properties.Rough SQL schema:I'm able to successfully map the basic properties of each subclass in my Hibernate mapping files, but I'm having trouble figuring out how to map the association between the PriceDiscountBenefit subclass and the Plan class. I imagine this is because the primary key of the subclass table (BenefitDetails_PriceDiscount) isn't simply the map_id column - in other words, multiple rows in this subclass table will form a single PriceDiscountBenefit entity. From what I can see, it seems as if table-per-subclass support in Hibernate is meant for instances where a single row in the subclass table maps to a single row in the parent table - and mapping a  should refer to a second table which contains the keys/values.Am I mapping this completely wrong? I can't tell if I'm having trouble because I'm butchering the table-per-subclass pattern. ",1

Web User Interface for a Java application,"I'm trying to create a web user interface for a Java application. The user interface is going to be very simple, consisting of a single page with a form for users to pose their queries, and a results page -- sort of like Google's search engine or Ask.com. I'm quite familiar with the base API of Java, but I don't have much experience in using Java for Web environments (though I've used ASP.NET), so I'm looking for some advice:What web application server should I use? Note that my interface is very light, and I just want something that is fast, easy to start/reset/stop and (re)deploy my application. Also, I need it to work on multiple environments, namely, GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows XP/Vista. Additionally, I'm using ant and Eclipse, so it would be great if I could easily add some ant targets for server management, and/or manage the server using the IDE. I've looked into Tomcat and Jetty, and the latter seems to be very light and easy to install and deploy. This is ideal, because the GUI is just for demonstration purposes, and I'll probably need to deploy it in different computers. However, Tomcat has been around for a very long time, and it seems more mature.As for the web pages, Java Server Pages look like a good fit, as they seem sufficiently simple for what I'm trying to accomplish (processing a form and outputting the result), but I'm all ears for suggestions. I also have another requirement, which requires me to explain the ""basic"" workflow of the application: Basically, I have a class Engine which has a method run(String) which will process the user's input and return the results for display. This class is the core of the application. Now, I'd like to instantiate this class only once, as it requires a lot of memory, and takes a very long time to startup, so I'd like to create it when the application/server starts, and store that reference for the entire span of the application (i.e., until I stop the server). Then, for each user request, I'd simply invoke the run method of the Engine instance, and display its results. How can this be accomplished in Java?",1

persisting dynamic properties and query,"I have a requirement to implement contact database. This contact database is special in a way that user should be able to dynamically (on runtime) add properties he/she wants to track about the contact. Some of these properties are of type string, other numbers and dates. Some of the properties have pre-defined values, others are free fields etc.. User wants to be also able to query such structure fast and easily. The database needs to handle easily 500 000 contacts each having around 10 properties.It leads to dynamic property model having Contact class with dynamic properties.The question is how can I store such a structure in ""some database"" - it does not have to be RDBMS so that I can easily express queries such as Get all contacts whose name starts with Martin, they are from Company of size 5000 or less, order by time when this contact was inserted in a database, only first 100 results (provide pagination), where each of these segments correspond to a dynamic property.I need:filtering - equal, partial equal, (bigger, smaller for integers, dates) and maybe aggregation - but it is not necessary at this pointsortingpaginationI was considering RDBMS, but this leads more less to this structure which is quite hard to query and it tends to be slow for this amount of dataI consider following options:store contacts in RDBMS and use Lucene for querying - is there anything that would help with this?Store dynamic properties as XML and store it to rdbms and use xpath support - unfortunatelly it seems to be pretty slow for 500000 contactsuse another database - Mango DB or Jackrabbit to store this informationWhich way would you go and why?",1

Scripting and basic development tools for Windows?,"I'm seeking suggestions for tools I can use on Windows to perform simple scripting and general Java development related tasks on a command line or other non-GUI interface (i.e. moving files about, starting/stopping servers, running Maven, etc.).

Data Types on the fly,"Is it possible to dynamically declare arrays or variables after compilation? I ask because it is the only way I can think to solve this problem I've been running in to.What I am trying to do is take an arbitrarily large set of numbers, find the midrange, and divide that set into two smaller subsets. Kinda like a quicksort (which I have no idea how to implement by the way).The reason I believe Ill need to be able to declare these datatypes after compilation is because I want to be able to create an arbitrary amount of subsets as well, based off user input. So, for example if the user specifies 8 levels then the program should be able to divide the original set with the method described above, and repeat that with all the subsequent subsets. It appears, to me that in order to organize the numbers in this way would require the use of arrays, hence the problem I'm running into.Is there a simpler way to approach this problem? If there is I'd really appreciate some insight. And if not, how can I do what I described above?To clarify, I am writing this program in Java, and no, this is not a homework assignment.

When one thread completes processing another thread takes another file name from the list and starts the process.So I need some mechanism to have three threads and checking them whether they are alive or not and accordingly starts a new thread and the file list also gets updated frequently.I also looked into ExecutorService but while the list get updated I could not provide it updated list.Thanks,Sandeep",1
Integration testing environment set up with Maven with not embedable dependency,"I would like to discuss scenario when the part of our product is not embedable in JVM but has to take part during integration testing.Scenario: I am using Maven. My app uses following tools  A) Active MQ  B) Cassandra DB  C) CXF WebService.   Solution 1 to integration testing: I am lucky that all A B and C are embedable. So I could just mock up A B C in my JVM and use it. This obviously works but this is not what I would like to discuss.Solution 2: Use Maven phases related to integration testing to setup whole enviro. So steps:  1a) package A, B, C binaries to module so that it can unpack and prepare these products in pre-integration-test phase (something like homemade Cargo)   OR   1b) in pre-integration-test phase download these binaries from web and unpack etc etc (again emulating cargo project)  2) shut everything down in post-integration-test. How to carry out the solution 2 with Maven? Is there any plugin that would help with downloading, unpacking (and remembering not downloading again on same machine?). How to start up and shut down ABC provided their's location is known? Which Maven plugin? Should I just use antrun plugin and create scripts that will start up ABC from command line and then somehow tear them down (i dont know how to do this maybe by killing processes)?",0
JAVA OOD Question,"I have been learning Spring for past few months and found out that's its not only powerful but beautifully written framework. I want to write a small Forum Web Application using Spring, Spring Security, JPA, and for front end Jquery UI. Just for educational purposes I want to write this app. My problem is very simple i.e designing this application in like what classes, interfaces, what design patterns where to use. I am afraid of one thing I don't want to make it a cookie clutter just to add the things. I want to follow the right steps and make it so easy yet powerful that I can give it to community so that people can use it if they want.

maven; how to break backwards compatibility?,"Maven has a version management system that picks the highest version of a library if multiple versions are referenced. For example if a pom A refers to a version 1.1 and and pom B to 1.2, then a pom C (referring to both A and B) will use the highest version; 1.2.This approach assumes that 1.2 is 100% backwards compatible with 1.1 and this is a good and required approach. However, at certain times in the lifecycle of libraries it is wise to clean up shop. For me any major changes in the API means increasing the major version, so a 2.0 does not need to be 100% backwards compatible to the latest 1.x. Fine.Maven, however, does not really care and if pom B would be upgraded from 1.2 to 2.0, Maven would then use 2.0, but pom A cannot work with that version.How to tell Maven that a version is no longer backwards compatible?I've tried specifying excluding ranges, so A refers [1.1,1.999) and B refers [2.0,2.999). However, Maven still solves the maximum version number (2.0).",0

JUnit @Ignore usefulness?,"In JUnit you can use @Ignore before methods to tell the test runner to automatically skip those tests.

(Assuming these tests are all self contained.)  Is there some way to obtain a list of the ignored test cases in JUnit on Netbeans?  If not, how much usefulness does the @Ignore tag really have, since it might be more useful to fail the test so it's not overlooked?",0

Despite a bit of research and asking around in class, working with Nodes has got me very confused. I'm sure it's something simple I am missing, but I am at a complete loss right now. Here is the class in which the List is stored (I think). It is titled Aircraft because we are creating a list to store multiple aircraft and some details associated with them (name of flight, speed, altitude, type of plane). I have a Main class (not listed) which the user interacts with - I've got that class pretty much taken care of. Below, I have what I believe to be the class in which the Nodes are created and stored. This is where I am very confused and think I have it wrong. I am not sure how to call upon a node to actually add and store data to it. I will also need to be able to get the node (via the flight name) and remove the node (via the flight name)",1

adding a external file to a build.xml - java / xml,"I have two classes, ZipComparison and Tczip.

Merging JTextArea with JTextPane,"My program originaly had JTextAreas, but when I needed to change spacing between rows of characters, I was forced to use JTextPanes.

What worked for me was to select the option ""Copy required libraries into a sub-folder next to the generated JAR."" Here, another folder is created next to where your .jar is output containing the referenced .jar libraries.Update2: The other option which works is ""Extract required libraries into generated JAR."" Doing so allows the JAR to access the references internally. It seemed as though the same would have worked with N.L.telaviv 's suggestion, but that does not appear to be the case. Choose this option if you don't want to have any extra files. You'll notice, if you explore the .JAR file, that the external library is in a separate package folder.",0

Passing a Set of Objects between threads,"The current project I am working on requires that I implement a way to efficiently pass a set of objects from one thread, that runs continuously, to the main thread. The current setup is something like the following. I have a main thread which creates a new thread. This new thread operates continuously and calls a method based on a timer. This method fetches a group of messages from an online source and organizes them in a TreeSet. This TreeSet then needs to be passed back to the main thread so that the messages it contains can be handled independent of the recurring timer. For better reference my code looks like the followingAs can be seen by some of the commenting, my current preferred way to handle this is by creating an event in the timer thread if there are messages. The main thread will then be listening for this event and handle it appropriately. Presently I am unfamiliar with how Java handles events, or how to create/listen for them. I also do not know if it is possible to create events and have the information contained within them passed between threads. Can someone please give me some advice/insight on whether or not my methods are possible? If so, where might I find some information on how to implement them as my current searching attempts are not proving fruitful. If not, can I get some suggestions on how I would go about this, keeping in mind I would like to avoid having to manage sockets if at all possible.EDIT 1: The main thread will also be responsible for issuing commands based on the messages it receives, or issuing commands to get required information. For this reason the main thread cannot wait on receiving messages, and should handle them in an event based manner. ",1

Can Maven install POM when building and artifact with classifier?,"I have a Maven project, which uses JAR packaging. When I run the install phase, it will install both Project-1.0.jar and Project-1.0.pom files in my local repository.Now I would like the JAR to be built with a classifier. This is easy enough: I just add the line to my jar plugin configuration:Now, this works in that it installs Project-1.0-whatever.jar in my repo, but no longer installs a POM.In case it matters, I want to use this feature in conjunction with profiles, i.e. I want to build JARs with different classifiers with different profiles.The reason I want the POM is because I have other projects depending on this one. When I build one of these, it will try to find a POM for this dependency. If it can't, it will happily use the JAR, but that is not an acceptable solution for me for a couple of reasons:It's bad enough that it will try to contact external repos and look for it, but even worse, we use a share repo, so it will download the POM from the shared repo, which may not be what I want - for example if I just made changes to the POM and am trying to test them.Is there a solution, or can anyone suggest a reasonable workaround?EDIT: I just discovered that the issue affects Maven 2.2.1, but not Maven 3.0.5. This may therefore be a bug or a difference in features between versions. I would still be interested in solutions/workarounds for Maven 2, as migrating the project to Maven 3 is a complicated affair and not likely to happen.",0

What is the established way to request data from an android device,"I currently have an small application that I have been using to learn java/android programming.  Right now I have a setup were the app on one phone sends a request (via sms) to another phone running the same app.  The remote phone receives the request and sends back some info.  Next I would like to try this from the web.  Is there an established ""best"" way to to this?I was thinking I would have a web server send requests to the device via google cloud messaging and then have the device return the data directly to the web server.  (Not that I really know how to do any of that just yet).I see that there is a google cloud messaging return path (send messages from the device to the google cloud server,  but it seems very new,  do I need something like that?

Multiple ways of declaring dependencies in Maven IntelliJ projects,"In new Maven projects in IntelliJ, I see 2 ways of declaring new dependencies:Manually editing the pom.xml file, adding a  declaration.This automatically (maven auto-import is on) adds Maven: ... entries to the project .iml file and all is well.Using the File -> Project Structure -> Dependencies menu. This only creates entries in the .iml file.This seems like unwanted behavior. IntelliJ doesn't overwrite the .iml file when importing the pom.xml Maven file, but merges dependencies from the pom.xml and additionally-defined ones from the .iml. I want to enforce a single way of adding dependencies in my team (using pom.xml only, for external mvn builds), and the ability to bypass the pom.xml and directly add dependencies to the .iml creates the illusion of a valid build (when in fact, it is not).Am I missing something? How can I enforce one way of adding dependencies? Is there a way through which IntelliJ will add dependencies to the pom.xml file instead of the .iml files?EDITIn this question (IntelliJ IDEA + Maven what is the need for dependency entries in an iml file?) it is claimed that   This can be also used to experiment with dependencies without changing the pom.xml. Note that all the modifications you make will be reverted on next Maven import.But this is not the behavior I see. The .iml file doesn't get reverted, but merged.",0

"Handling non-OSGi dependencies when integrating Maven, Tycho and Eclipse","I have a bunch of Eclipse-based plugins that I have been migrating to Maven/Tycho. Most of these plugins depend on separate libraries that I now manage through Maven, rather than muddle around with .jar files.The most cumbersome part of my current setup is due to the apparent inability of Tycho to process Maven-only (i.e. non-OSGi) artifacts. My current setup works like this:In the pom.xml of each Eclipse plugin I issue an unpack goal to maven-dependency-plugin during the initialize phase. This unpacks the artifacts that I specify to a separate target/dependencies directory.The target/dependencies directory is added as an output directory in build.properties, so that Tycho can add it to the classpath when compiling:The target/dependencies directory is added to the Bundle-ClassPath library in META-INF/MANIFEST.MF.These settings allow the compile Maven directive to compile the plugin. Importing the project from VCS and manually specifying the target/dependencies directory as a class folder in Eclipse allows said IDE to also compile the plugin.Unfortunately this is a rather cumbersome solution for a few reasons:Configuring the maven-dependency-plugin requires listing all artifacts that should be unpacked. One could use unpack-dependencies instead of unpack, but that would also unpack all OSGi dependencies - having half of Eclipse unpacked in each project directory is not my idea of fun...Adding the class folder in Eclipse requires Maven initialize to be run once, so that the target/dependencies directory is created.There is no source connection between the pure Maven projects and their depending Tycho projects in Eclipse. For a change to propagate from a Maven project to an Tycho project, so that e.g. Eclipse may show a potential compilation problem, one has to mvn install the Maven project and then run mvn clean initialize in the Tycho project to remove the previously unpacked dependencies and pull in the current set. Then you have to refresh the Eclipse project and hope that Eclipse does the right thing.In the same vein, viewing the source of a dependency from a Tycho project will not show the primary source file, but rather whatever is available in target/dependencies - quite possibly just a .class file.I am thinking that there must be a more reasonable way to go about this - something that would allow Eclipse and Maven projects to integrate more tightly.So, what am I missing? What is the recommended setup for this use case? Is there a better alternative? Preferably something that would not require setting a bunch of Nexus and/or p2 repositories?",0

Java -- Closing Scanner and Resource Leak,"I'm learning Java and working on some projects for fun. One issue that I have run in to is that when I use a Scanner object Eclipse warns me that:  Resource Leak: 'scan' is never closed.So, I added a scan.close(); at the end of my code and that takes care of the warning. The problem comes in because I have other classes in the same package that also use scanner objects and and Eclipse tells me to close scanner in those classes respectively. However, when I do that it seems like it closes ALL of the scanner objects and I get errors during run time. Here is an example of what causes the error:After scanner is closed in the scanTest class and the do loop in test2 is entered again an error occurs at the line test = scan.nextInt();I tried moving the creation of the scanner object into the do loop just to make a new object every time as well but the error still occurs.

One post I came across mentioned that when System.in is closed I cannot be re-opened.

How to convert a non-gradle JUnit project (that uses Hibernate and EntityManager) to a gradle Junit project and keep it working,"I have a JPA/Hibernate project that implements a number of repository interfaces (I use DDD) and I have another project that tests the first one, by using JUnit 4. My IDE is Eclipse Luna. I learned later that I could made a single project with both runtime and testing code, but at this moment, I have them separated in those two projects.Everything works perfectly so far.Now, I decided to convert my test project in a Gradle project. After converting, I created this build.gradle fileThe compile works perfectly, but when I run the tests, iether in Eclipse or by Gradle, I have the folowing exceptionI stress that nothing changed in the Java code and it ran perfectly before Gradle came into the scene.So, it appears that after converting the project to a Gradle one, persistence.xml is not being reachable anymore during the JUnit run, and I can't get the EntityManager instance I need to perform the tests.I browsed a large number of posts about problems relating JUnit, resource files and Gradle, but no one of them could give me an idea about how to fix the problem.Any ideas?

How to import API definition from .jar without embedding .jar on compliation?,"I'm building a module-based demo project in Java. The aim is to build a super small Core Application that will only connect modules between them. Modules, once connected, will communicate directly through APIs sepecific to every module.Every module, because it'll be developped independently, will have to be its own jar, and will be able to be compiled on its own and be integrated in the Core App by simply putting the .jar of the module into a specific folder. The Core App will then load these modules (at startup or runtime if possible) using the ServiceLoader API.All the projects will use Maven, and be developped in Eclipse.Every module will implement an IModule interface defining basic methods to connect modules (simply share references of instanciated modules between them), and this interface is defined in its own .jar.This design pattern requires that some modules (let's say Module1) are aware of the API of the others with which they will communicate (Module2).How can I make Module1 aware of the API of Module2 without compiling them together? I'm currently thinking adding the Module2.jar to the Build Path of Module1, but I'm not sure if this will integrate the whole Module2.jar in the Module1.jar during the compilation. And if once loaded, both modules will be able to communicate.And Can I do these things in a ""Maven-ess"" way ?Keep in mind that I'm far (far) from being an Java expert and that this app will be a ""demo"" app. If the development of this demo app goes well (and thus I'd prove that this pattern is suitable for my needs), I might implement it in a real world application.

Once such value in X is found, it becomes futher checking, but now it replaces Y with first succesfull X etc.In example above. 11 - no. 12 - yes. 22 - no (related to 12). 32 - yes. 56 - no.As a result I want to have to sum of successful matches, in this case - 2.To get values from array I use this code:  I find difficulties with matching algorithm, as once I have a success, I have to change to number I matching with.

How to properly use StyledEditorKit for aligning text,"Basically, what I want to do is to center text that I've selected with my mouse (through normal left click, drag over the words, they turn blue. No special highlighting functions or anything like that.) and then allign it either to the left, center, or right. I already have buttons and actionListeners set up to handle this, I just need the code inside the actionListener. To be clear, I don't want to use this:This centers the entire text field, and that's not what I'm looking for. What I am looking for is very similar to what you see in word processors now where only the selected text is alligned. This way I can have one line of text that is left alligned, and then the one right below it can be center alligned. I've fiddled with StyledEditorKit before, and I think that was what I need to use. I'm guessing I can use the StyledEditorKit.AlignmentAction, however, the method requires a string and an integer, and doesn't really specify what these are for. Would a StyledEditorKit be the best way to do this? Or is there a more efficient way that I'm just not aware of?",1

Setting up an environment where I use Clojure to unit-test a pure Java library,"I have to write a pure Java library.

I can have code from both projects open in Emacs at the same time, but I want to know how to automate the connection.For example, ideally, whenever I do ""lein test"", it would grab the most up-to-date Java code, compile it (if it isn't compiled), pull it into the Clojure project and use it in the tests.

Maven/Retrolambda: how to detect dependencies on Java 8 classes,"Background:We have maven-based java project, which targets JRE 1.7, but the source code uses lambdas, so we use retrolambda for transforming Java 8 source code to Java 7. Also we use [StreamSupport](""https://github.com/streamsupport/streamsupport"") backport library when we need streams, function.*, Optional, etc.Usage of retrolambda involves configuring the project's both source and target language level to 1.8. Everything works fine if there are no dependencies on java8 classes or methods (like java.util.stream.*, java.util.Optional, or methods introduced in java8 like Collection.forEach). If there are such usages then build passes, but it fails in runtime, when running under JVM of Java 8. Question:My goal is to fail the build in case when such dependencies exist. Is there any way of detecting dependencies on new Java 8 classes/methods in build-time? I thought about 2 possible options, but I'm not sure whether either of them is doable: Some kind of bytecode analyzer for detecting depdencies on predefined classes and methods.

I'm posting because 1. those threads are over 1yr old, and 2. I'm hoping to learn how to find root causes for onset of this behavior.We have an OAS/OC4J (it's not our fault!) 24/7 Java application server running on RHEL5/Redhat 5.11, Java 6. This has been stable memory-wise for many years until recently when we started seeing high CPU utilization due to frequent CMS tenured space cycles. This happens even when there's more than ample space in both young and tenured spaces. My reading on this topic suggests that a CMS tenured cycle typically commences when tenured (Old gen) space is roughly 92% of capacity. But we see this repeatedly happening with 30% capacity even less. And also, I should mention, when the total heap seems less than the default 45% value for overall heap usage, aka InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent.We are still reviewing recent code changes and have tried a few things, but these issues persist. So, far we're unable to reproduce outside of production servers, although efforts in a dev/qa environment are ongoing.I think I have three main questions here:What might be triggering the frequent (premature?) Initial-Mark phase of the CMS cycle. And, how might we verify or investigate this? E.g., inspect various segments of current memory allocations (eden, survivor, old-gen) for huge objects or the like?I've read about using -XX:+UseCMSInitiatingOccupancyOnly and -XX:CMSInitiatingOccupancyFraction=NN (for example in articles referenced above). What might be a reasonable (== safe) value for NN, and what are the risks of overriding the default CMS ergonomics this way? Any other things we should consider or investigate?Here are some details about our issue:So, far we're unable to reproduce this outside of production. So, debugging or tuning isn't an optionWe use a nightly cron job to force a Full GC to mitigate fragmentation via jmap -histo:live pidOur JVM command line args wrt memory are below:-XX:+PrintGCDetails-XX:+PrintGCDateStamps-XX:+PrintTenuringDistribution-XX:-TraceClassUnloading-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC-XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError-XX:+ExplicitGCInvokesConcurrent-XX:+UseCMSCompactAtFullCollection-Xms10g-Xmx10g-Xmn3g-XX:SurvivorRatio=6-XX:PermSize=256m-XX:MaxPermSize=256m-XX:TargetSurvivorRatio=80-XX:ParallelGCThreads=8Note: we recently tried bumping the young generation to 3.5g as a somewhat desperate experiment.

Resolve duplicate versions of dependency,"This has been very annoying. I have 2 projects, project A and B, B with dependency on A as a JAR file. So a 3rd library X in A has a dependency on another 3rd party library Y, the problem is maven resolves Y in project A to a version, but in project B to another version, like the following:And the version below is specified in project A:In the POM.xml of project B, there isn't really any explicitly specified version of dependencies.In project A:In project B that only introduces the dependency on Y because of A:The ideal solution is to only make changes in pom.xml in project B to solve the duplicate versions dependency hell. Any idea? Thanks!Is it possible to make project B inherit dependencies from A.jar instead of introducing those of its own.EDITIn the end I found something that worked, so I'd just put it here in case someone may be facing the same problem later.The key is to put the dependencies come with project A into exclusions, so maven won't just use the versions of libraries defined in project A, but work out a version based on the current context.

"Set up a server that connects to a database, obtains the information from it, then sends it to an Android application","I have this seemingly complicated project to do: I have an android application that has to connect to a server, and that server has to provide this application information from a database.Now, I have to write this server from scratch, in Java (because that's the language that I know and I want to use). Here's my plan:1) Create the database, populate it with information (from the MySQL terminal, for now). Eventually, this server that I'm creating actually has to connect to another server and obtain the information from there, and then populate the database with that information. But I'm not at that stage yet.2) Create a server (I'm guessing, use Tomcat 7) in which a few classes are ""running"": one that connects to the database using JDBC to obtain the information from there and create a new object from each record it gets from there (not exactly sure how I do that); and another class that acts either as a JSON endpoint or as a sockets connection server (never did anything like this in my life - sure, I've connected to a JSON endpoint in the past, but I  have never created a JSON endpoint myself, server-side). This connection has to be updated (new information from the database has to be sent from the server, or requested from the server) every 2 seconds or so, so it works in a real-time manner.3) Create a way in my Android application to obtain the information from the server. If the solution at the server-side is a JSON endpoint, then obviously, connect to that JSON endpoint and obtain the information like that. If it's a sockets connection, apparently, the server should push the information on a certain port regardless if any client is connected or not to that port. Again, no idea how to do that exactly.4) Then, in Android, parse the data and use it to be displayed on the screen, in lists etc (that's the later stage, once I get the data in my actual application, from the server).What would you guys recommend? What should be my approach?I suppose I should install some kind of server like Tomcat 7 and then... how do I actually ""run"" the classes that connect to the database and how do I create the JSON endpoint so my application can connect to it?Obviously I will look through tutorials in the meantime, but how do I get these classes, assuming I'm building them, to actually RUN in Tomcat (meaning, to actually be visible on the IP of the machine that runs as the server)?I know these are quite a few issues I'm presenting here, but... this is what I have to do. Any help will be appreciated.Furthermore, do you see a sockets connection as a viable option for my application, instead of JSON? (although, in the Android world, JSON seems to be ""the norm""). Remember, for now, I will have to have this information updated every two seconds. How do I maintain the connection open between my application and the server so that it doesn't do a request every time or anything like that?Again, thanks for any help!",1
How to avoid Java dependency hell when using Maven multi-module projects,"I have been battling dependencies on a Java Maven multi-module project for a couple of days. With too little oversight developers managed to create a situation where modules each can be compiled on their own but not as a single whole together. This results in all kinds of errors. Classes that cannot be found, casting errors etc etc. The cause of these problems seems impossible to determine.My suspicion is that Maven puts conflicting dependencies on the class path. I think we made a mess of the Maven dependencies but regardless I don't understand how Maven can be such a poor performing framework for multi-module projects. Now I can understand that Maven tries to do very smart useful things when compiling multiple modules as a whole but shouldn't there be an option in Maven to just configure a module to be isolated from other modules? Is there such an option? To avoid this dependency hell?Or is the Maven best practice to create other scripts, bash scripts for example to be able to compile multiple modules in isolation, with one command?But that is also poort workaround some tools for example SonarQube require  ability to run Maven on the whole code base in order to create a single project in SonarQube.",0

Eclipse does not reload compiled css while running,"TLDR;Eclipse does not seem to detect changes in compiled css file and does not reload them on a running server.ProblemI can successfully generate css files from less files using [wro4j](""https://github.com/wro4j/wro4j"") everytime i update a less file.I have followed [this](""https://spring.io/blog/2015/01/12/spring-and-angular-js-a-secure-single-page-application"") tutorial from the official spring boot website itself.Text from the tutorial  The wro4j-maven-plugin has some Eclipse integration features and you  can install it from the Eclipse Marketplace (try it later if this is  your first time - it’s not needed to complete the application). If you  do that then Eclipse will watch the source files and re-generate the  outputs if they change. If you run in debug mode then changes are  immediately re-loadable in a browser.I have used the [wro4j eclipse integration](""https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/m2e-wro4j"") which re generates the output if the source less file changes, but these changes are not re loadable in the browser.However, If I manually modify the compiled css after generation, the change is successfully reloaded by eclipse/spring-boot. So currently after i make changes to the less files, css files are generated but is not picked up by the running server. I have to open the compiled file, type a space and do a backspace and save it, only then it's reloaded.Any ideas on how to solve this problem?EDIT:Eclipse is reloading all the changes except if the file has been auto generated.For eg. If i modify one of my html files it reloads them right away.But if i modify a less file, which in turn modified the css file.. this stays the same..even after restart.

I learned to work with JSON - based website and to show the results(after downloading the data) in a ListView. Now i have the problem that i dont have JSON in front of me and i have really no clue about how i can write a code which extracts relevant information of HTML - Webpage. Is it even possible? Sorry if maybe of u may laugh now how unknowing i am but i try to learn:) So i basically know much about Asynctask and Databases. But the point is i dont know how to connect them all with my specific problem.Thank you in advance for all who will deal with my topic!",1

OOP Class Responsibility,"I'm developing a hobby project to properly understand encapsulation, what classes can be responsible for, and rules. I asked for a code review and assistance in another [forum](""https://coderanch.com/t/686387/java/Code-Review""), but I don't agree with the approach given. I have the following requirements:An international student requires documents to complete the registration process, but domestic students don't. StudentStatus Interface:Student class:University class:Before I continue, I understand that this is a really over simplified application process. In the real world, a lot more has to happen before a Student can register. The student may have to go through entrance exams, and payment before registration begins. Also, in a realistic environment, this information would probably be stored in a database that the campus employees can access. In the other forum, the conversation went into what information is being given out, and approaches were given.Have a rule class, that takes the Student object and verifies that itis in fact international and has documents.The problem I have with this, is you're still going to have to ask the Student his/her status either with the retriveStatus() or isVerified(), I don't really see how to do it any other way. Pass the Student and collection of documents separately to be added to the Map.In the real world, the University set the rule as stated above and it's responsibility is to check if International students have documentation.When I suggested the approach above with the add(Student student) they stated it wasn't a good idea because the rules can change, and you'll have to change the Student class as well as the University class. However, in the real world, a student is well aware of his/her status and if he/she is domestic/international and in possession of documents that can be given to the school. Given the above approach, is writing the add method this way a good idea? Is there a better approach than the add method?tl;dr - If a Student has to follow the rules set by the University, how then would the Student object communicate with the University to get the data so that the University can ensure the student object is complying with the rules without breaking encapsulation?

According to the documentation, using ""simple"" requires that user.name=username be included as a query string parameter when first accessing WebHDFS via a web console. I don't think using simple has anything to do with client application authentication via OAuth to WebHDFS, but I thought I should mention it if it does play a role. I then created a Java client application to access the WebHDFS endpoint. I have configured WebHDFS for SSL so that both the WebHDFS endpoint and the token management server listen using the HTTPS protocol. Here is the main method of a small java application I wrote to access the root of my WebHDFS endpoint (hdserver.local): This returns properly without requiring that I retrieve a bearer token from my token endpoint and send that along to WebHDFS for authentication.

For example, when there is an existing JSON object as below in the .json file: [  {    ""waterSpace"": 4.0,    ""airSpace"": 5.0,    ""landSpace"": 3.0,    ""name"": ""robbie"",    ""penType"": ""pen""  }]but when I use .put to add it does the following    [  {    ""waterSpace"": 4.0,    ""airSpace"": 5.0,    ""landSpace"": 3.0,    ""name"": ""robbie"",    ""penType"": ""pen""  }]{""waterSpace"": 4.0,    ""airSpace"": 5.0,    ""landSpace"": 3.0,    ""name"": ""robbie"",    ""penType"": ""pen""  }How can I use GSON to add the objects from the arraylist properly so the formatting is correct and it looks like the below:[  {    ""waterSpace"": 4.0,    ""airSpace"": 5.0,    ""landSpace"": 3.0,    ""name"": ""robbie"",    ""penType"": ""pen""  },{""waterSpace"": 4.0,    ""airSpace"": 5.0,    ""landSpace"": 3.0,    ""name"": ""robbie"",    ""penType"": ""pen""  }]",1
Java operations on an array of integers,"I'm considering an array of integers in Java. The array size is determined at the start of the program by the userMy idea idea is that - given any position for the corresponding binary values - the result should show 1 for any bit where only one of the operands has a 1 and 0 for any other combination. The process can be better explained by the following examplesAn array such {4,5,6} should return 3 because:OR for the numbers {12,4,9}I thought of doing it this way but I realized that - since I worked with XOR - my code for the first example will return 7 :How to implement this operation correctly?",1

Passing a variable through a method in Java,"I'm here to ask a little help with a problem I've had for many hours. In practice, I would like to be able to pass the variables 'j' and 'k' through a method in a matrix. The problem lies in passing them, which, without understanding the reason, are not ""captured"" when they enter the if. In fact, if I try to print 'r' and 'c' before the if, they match. I do not understand where I'm wrong, because the other things inside the if work perfectly, but when I try to print 'r' and 'c' inside the if, they always turn out to be 0.Buttons creation :The method :Thanks in advance for the help.Code for a test :}",1
Scan multiple maven poms for different dependency versions,I have different maven projects to maintain and would like to aligned the used versions of the dependencies.My goal would be to scan all the POMs (they are not necessary parent/child poms) for their dependencies and if there is a dependency to the same artifact it should compare the versions and list them if they don't match - so that I can see if there is a reason for having different versions.Is there any tooling support for that task - or would I have to implement something my self?,0
How to put local dependencies first when calling gradle idea?,"When calling gradle idea, external dependencies are ordered first in the class path relatively to local Jar inclusions. As such :will include my local jars last.

It is put last in the classpath. I have found several mentions of the problem when researching, such as [https://discuss.gradle.org/t/gradle-messes-up-the-classpath-order-in-generated-projects-when-there-are-mixed-dependency-types/13130](""https://discuss.gradle.org/t/gradle-messes-up-the-classpath-order-in-generated-projects-when-there-are-mixed-dependency-types/13130""), but no workarounds.I suppose these exist, gradle being very customisable, but being very new to it my attempts to make one fail.
