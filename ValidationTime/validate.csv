This can cause further complications if items are added to the list, with this incorrect generic type information.  Any code still holding a reference to the list but with the correct generic type information will now have an inconsistent list.  To remove the warning, try:--CODE--However, note that you will not be able to use certain methods such as add because the compiler doesn't know if you are trying to add an object of incorrect type.

First, it creates a dependency on a particular operating system, which prevents the application from easily moving to another operating system.

Using an absolute path like this makes the code much less portable.Second, depending on the relative location of the file, this technique might create an external dependency and limit the application__ mobility. If the file exists outside the application__ current directory, this creates an external dependency and one would have to be aware of the dependency in order to move the application to another machine (error prone).Instead, use the getResource() methods in the Class class.

Most of our code are legacy and there are tons of singleton references. We've bunched all of them to a single ""Application Context"" singleton. What we now need is to create some way to separate the shared context (shared across all applets currently showing) and non-shared context (specific to each applet currently showing). However, we don't have an ID at each of the locations that call to the singleton, nor do we want to propagate the ID to all locations. What's the easiest way to identify in which applet context we're running?

If you could split most of the code into a common class loader (as a parent of each per-applet class loader) and into the normal applet codebase, that would be faster but more work.Other hacks:If you have access to any component, you can use Component.getParent repeatedly or SwingUtilities.getRoot.If you are in a per-applet instance thread, then you can set up a ThreadLocal.From the EDT, you can read the current event from the queue (java.awt.EventQueue.getCurrentEvent()), and possibly find a component from that.

This should yield two serialized arrays where the array containing the two-byte characters should have length +1.Plus if the solution is elegant for Java.
