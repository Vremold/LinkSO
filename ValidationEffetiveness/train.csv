584234,584261,Problem with threads,"*I'm using Java.I have this thread, agent, that explores a room to determine its size and clean it if it's dirty. Then I have the interface, which draws the agent as it explores the environment. Agent is subclassed from Thread, and Java takes care of managing the threads. All I do is create the thread and say object.start().This works very well under normal circustances. However, the menus are enabled during this time, and that means the user can mess with the room while the agent is exploring it. That shouldn't happen.So, once the user clicks the option that tells the agent to clean the room, I'd like to disable all the menus. Except this isn't working as it should.

I thought about using Thread.join() - that would garantee that the code to enable the menus is only executed after the agent thread ends.

Pros: Easy. Cons: The situation is rarely that simple.If task3 is on a separate thread, you could use java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch shared between all threads. Task 3 will wait for the latch while task1 and task2 will decrease it. Pros: quite easy, oblivious to the environment. Cons: require T3 to be created before it's really needed.If task3 should only be created AFTER task1 and task2 are finished (no separate thread for it until after task1 and task2 finishes), you'd have to build something a bit more complex. I'd recommend either creating your own ExecutorService that take a condition n addition to the future and only executes the future when the condition changes, or creating a management service that will check conditions and submit given futures based on these conditions.
