If you're interested in quantifying how this happens, you could measure the actual time elapsed at the end of your for-loop and see if each iteration is waiting significantly longer than your 100 ms sleep time after the 12th thread starts. Another option could be to use the following code snippet to grab your JVM's ThreadMXBean instance and peruse its thread contention stats:--CODE--If you keep track of your thread's startup time in epoch millis, you can use it in conjunction with these last two methods to know how long the thread spent actually running on the CPU vs waiting for other threads.

You could calculate the total non-waiting/non-blocking time and compare that to how much time was actually available for your threads to run, and the difference would give you the total time your threads were pre-empted by your O/S.I suspect this probably doesn't give you the level of detail you're looking for, but I think this is about as close as you can get without writing a bunch of native, O/S-specific code and using JNI to access it within your Java program.","[""ThreadMXBean threadMXBean = ManagementFactory.getThreadMXBean();threadMXBean.setThreadContentionMonitoringEnabled(true);//Then, use specific thread IDs to get contention info periodically:int threadID = ... //you can use getId() on each thread you createdThreadInfo info = threadMXBean.getThreadInfo(threadID);info.getBlockedTime(); //returns millisinfo.getWaitedTime(); //returns millis""]",Concurrency,"{""Basic threading"": 0.9}"

However, if string manipulation works for you, then go for it! There are plenty of cases where small or simple XML text can be safely built by hand.Just be aware that creating XML text is harder than it looks. Here's some criteria I would consider:First: how much control do you have on the information that goes into the xml?The less control you have on the source data, the more likely you will have trouble, and the more advantageous the library becomes. For example: (a) Can you guarantee that the element names will never have a character that is illegal in a name? (b) How about quotes in an attribute's content? Can they happen, and are you handling them? (c) Does the data ever contain anything that might need to be encoded as an [entity](""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_entity"") (like the less-than which often needs to be output as &amp;lt;); are you doing it correctly?Second, maintainability: is the code that builds the XML easy to understand by someone else?You probably don't want to be stuck with the code for life.

Of course, if this is a personal project of yours, then you don't need to worry about ""others"": substitute ""in a year"" for ""others"" above.I wouldn't worry about performance. If your XML is simple enough that you can hand-write it, any overhead from the library is probably meaningless. Of course, your case might be different, but you should measure to prove it first.Finally, Yes; you can hand build XML text by hand if it's simple enough; but not knowing the libraries available is probably not the right reason.A modern XML library is a quite powerful tool, but it can also be daunting. However, learning the essentials of your XML library is not that hard, and it can be quite handy; among other things, it's almost a requisite in today's job marketplace.

The threads are only allowed to return from o.wait() one-by-one, but they each will get their turn.Simply put, it depends on why your threads are waiting to be notified. Do you want to tell one of the waiting threads that something happened, or do you want to tell all of them at the same time?In some cases, all waiting threads can take useful action once the wait finishes. An example would be a set of threads waiting for a certain task to finish; once the task has finished, all waiting threads can continue with their business. In such a case you would use notifyAll() to wake up all waiting threads at the same time.Another case, for example mutually exclusive locking, only one of the waiting threads can do something useful after being notified (in this case acquire the lock). In such a case, you would rather use notify(). Properly implemented, you could use notifyAll() in this situation as well, but you would unnecessarily wake threads that can't do anything anyway.In many cases, the code to await a condition will be written as a loop:--CODE--That way, if an o.notifyAll() call wakes more than one waiting thread, and the first one to return from the o.wait() makes leaves the condition in the false state, then the other threads that were awakened will go back to waiting.","[""synchronized(o) {    while (!

In my situation it would be used as a unique session/key identifier that would ""likely"" be unique over 500K+ generation (my needs don't really require anything much more sophisticated).  Ideally, I would be able to specify a length depending on my uniqueness needs. For example, a generated string of length 12 might look something like ""AEYGF7K0DM1X"".  ",[],<java><string><random><alphanumeric>,41156,"AlgorithmTo generate a random string, concatenate characters drawn randomly from the set of acceptable symbols until the string reaches the desired length.ImplementationHere's some fairly simple and very flexible code for generating random identifiers. Read the information that follows for important application notes.--CODE--Usage examplesCreate an insecure generator for 8-character identifiers:--CODE--Create a secure generator for session identifiers:--CODE--Create a generator with easy-to-read codes for printing. The strings are longer than full alphanumeric strings to compensate for using fewer symbols:--CODE--Use as session identifiersGenerating session identifiers that are likely to be unique is not good enough, or you could just use a simple counter. Attackers hijack sessions when predictable identifiers are used.There is tension between length and security. Shorter identifiers are easier to guess, because there are fewer possibilities. But longer identifiers consume more storage and bandwidth. A larger set of symbols helps, but might cause encoding problems if identifiers are included in URLs or re-entered by hand.The underlying source of randomness, or entropy, for session identifiers should come from a random number generator designed for cryptography. However, initializing these generators can sometimes be computationally expensive or slow, so effort should be made to re-use them when possible.Use as object identifiersNot every application requires security. Random assignment can be an efficient way for multiple entities to generate identifiers in a shared space without any coordination or partitioning. Coordination can be slow, especially in a clustered or distributed environment, and splitting up a space causes problems when entities end up with shares that are too small or too big.Identifiers generated without taking measures to make them unpredictable should be protected by other means if an attacker might be able to view and manipulate them, as happens in most web applications. There should be a separate authorization system that protects objects whose identifier can be guessed by an attacker without access permission.Care must be also be taken to use identifiers that are long enough to make collisions unlikely given the anticipated total number of identifiers. This is referred to as ""the birthday paradox."" [The probability of a collision,](""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem#Square_approximation"") p, is approximately n2/(2qx), where n is the number of identifiers actually generated, q is the number of distinct symbols in the alphabet, and x is the length of the identifiers. This should be a very small number, like 2&#8209;50 or less.Working this out shows that the chance of collision among 500k 15-character identifiers is about 2&#8209;52, which is probably less likely than undetected errors from cosmic rays, etc.Comparison with UUIDsAccording to their specification, [UUIDs](""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122#section-6"") are not designed to be unpredictable, and should not be used as session identifiers.UUIDs in their standard format take a lot of space: 36 characters for only 122 bits of entropy. (Not all bits of a ""random"" UUID are selected randomly.) A randomly chosen alphanumeric string packs more entropy in just 21 characters.UUIDs are not flexible; they have a standardized structure and layout. This is their chief virtue as well as their main weakness. When collaborating with an outside party, the standardization offered by UUIDs may be helpful. For purely internal use, they can be inefficient.","[""public class RandomString {    /**     * Generate a random string.     */    public String nextString() {        for (int idx = 0; idx < buf.length; ++idx)            buf[idx] = symbols[random.nextInt(symbols.length)];        return new String(buf);    }    public static final String upper = \""ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"";    public static final String lower = upper.toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT);    public static final String digits = \""0123456789\"";    public static final String alphanum = upper + lower + digits;    private final Random random;    private final char[] symbols;    private final char[] buf;    public RandomString(int length, Random random, String symbols) {        if (length < 1) throw new IllegalArgumentException();        if (symbols.length() < 2) throw new IllegalArgumentException();        this.random = Objects.requireNonNull(random);        this.symbols = symbols.toCharArray();        this.buf = new char[length];    }    /**     * Create an alphanumeric string generator.     */    public RandomString(int length, Random random) {        this(length, random, alphanum);    }    /**     * Create an alphanumeric strings from a secure generator.     */    public RandomString(int length) {        this(length, new SecureRandom());    }    /**     * Create session identifiers.     */    public RandomString() {        this(21);    }}"", ""RandomString gen = new RandomString(8, ThreadLocalRandom.current());"", ""RandomString session = new RandomString();"", ""String easy = RandomString.digits + \""ACEFGHJKLMNPQRUVWXYabcdefhijkprstuvwx\"";RandomString tickets = new RandomString(23, new SecureRandom(), easy);""]",Strings,"{""Operations on Strings"": 1.8}"

66455,86170,Is there an easy way to change the behavior of a Java/Swing control when it gets focus?,"For most GUI's I've used, when a control that contains text gets the focus, the entire contents of the control are selected.  This means if you just start typing, you completely replace the former contents.Example:  You have spin control that is initialized with the value zero.   You tab to it and type ""1"" The value in the control is now 1.With Swing, this doesn't happen.  The text in the control is not selected and the carat appears at one end or another of the existing text.  Continuing the above example:With a Swing JSpinner, when you tab to the spin control, the carat is at the left.  You type ""1"" and the value in the control is now 10.This drives me, (and my users) up a wall, and I'd like to change it.  Even more important, I'd like to change it globally so the new behavior applies to JTextField, JPasswordField, JFormattedTextField, JTextArea, JComboBox, JSpinner, and so on.   The only way I have found to do this to add a FocusAdapter to each control and override the focusGained() method to Do The Right Thing[tm].There's gotta be an easier, and less fragile way.

However, the menus are enabled during this time, and that means the user can mess with the room while the agent is exploring it. That shouldn't happen.So, once the user clicks the option that tells the agent to clean the room, I'd like to disable all the menus. Except this isn't working as it should. Here's the problem:--CODE--The problem is that the menus are enabled before the agent thread executes its function. I thought about using Thread.join() - that would garantee that the code to enable the menus is only executed after the agent thread ends. But, if I use Thread.join() the interface doesn't update itself while the agent is moving, because it's waiting for the agent to finish!I've thought about disabling the interface from the agent and then enabling it once the agent is done, but I'm not sure that would work and the biggest problem here is that the agent shouldn't be messing around with the menus.So, to sum it up, I need a thread executing to update the interface/draw the agent moving, but that thread cannot be the same that enables the menu.

Hence, this question is not ""Which one should I use?"" nor is it a performance question.  Rather, the question is ""Would it be safe?"")",[],<java><multithreading><concurrency><hashmap>,41990379,"Your idiom is safe if and only if the reference to the HashMap is safely published. Rather than anything relating the internals of HashMap itself, safe publication deals with how the constructing thread makes the reference to the map visible to other threads.Basically, the only possible race here is between the construction of the HashMap and any reading threads that may access it before it is fully constructed. Most of the discussion is about what happens to the state of the map object, but this is irrelevant since you never modify it - so the only interesting part is how the HashMap reference is published. For example, imagine you publish the map like this:--CODE--... and at some point setMap() is called with a map, and other threads are using SomeClass.MAP to access the map, and check for null like this:--CODE--This is not safe even though it probably appears as though it is. The problem is that there is no [happens-before](""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/memconsist.html"") relationship between the set of SomeObject.MAP and the subsequent read on another thread, so the reading thread is free to see a partially constructed map. This can pretty much do anything and even in practice it does things like [put the reading thread into an infinite loop](""http://mailinator.blogspot.com/2009/06/beautiful-race-condition.html"").To safely publish the map, you need to establish a happens-before relationship between the writing of the reference to the HashMap (i.e., the publication) and the subsequent readers of that reference (i.e., the consumption). Conveniently, there are only a few easy-to-remember ways to [[1]:Exchange the reference through a properly locked field (JLS 17.4.5](""https://stackoverflow.com/q/5458848/149138"">accomplish))Use static initializer to do the initializing stores ([JLS 12.4](""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-12.html#jls-12.4""))Exchange the reference via a volatile field ([JLS 17.4.5](""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-17.html#jls-17.4.5"")), or as the consequence of this rule, via the AtomicX classesInitialize the value into a final field ([JLS 17.5](""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-17.html#jls-17.5"")).The ones most interesting for your scenario are (2), (3) and (4). In particular, (3) applies directly to the code I have above: if you transform the declaration of MAP to:--CODE--then everything is kosher: readers who see a non-null value necessarily have a happens-before relationship with the store to MAP and hence see all the stores associated with the map initialization.The other methods change the semantics of your method, since both (2) (using the static initalizer) and (4) (using final) imply that you cannot set MAP dynamically at runtime. If you don't need to do that, then just declare MAP as a static final HashMap and you are guaranteed safe publication.In practice, the rules are simple for safe access to ""never-modified objects"":If you are publishing an object which is not inherently immutable (as in all fields declared final) and:You already can create the object that will be assigned at the moment of declarationa: just use a final field (including static final for static members).You want to assign the object later, after the reference is already visible: use a volatile fieldb.That's it!In practice, it is very efficient. The use of a static final field, for example, allows the JVM to assume the value is unchanged for the life of the program and optimize it heavily. The use of a final member field allows most architectures to read the field in a way equivalent to a normal field read and doesn't inhibit further optimizationsc. Finally, the use of volatile does have some impact: no hardware barrier is needed on many architectures (such as x86, specifically those that don't allow reads to pass reads), but some optimization and reordering may not occur at compile time - but this effect is generally small. In exchange, you actually get more than what you asked for - not only can you safely publish one HashMap, you can store as many more not-modified HashMaps as you want to the same reference and be assured that all readers will see a safely published map.For more gory details, refer to [Shipilev](""https://shipilev.net/blog/2014/safe-public-construction/"") or [this FAQ by Manson and Goetz](""https://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/memoryModel/jsr-133-faq.html#finalRight"").[1] Directly quoting from [shipilev](""https://shipilev.net/blog/2014/safe-public-construction/"").a That sounds complicated, but what I mean is that you can assign the reference at construction time - either at the declaration point or in the constructor (member fields) or static initializer (static fields).b Optionally, you can use a synchronized method to get/set, or an AtomicReference or something, but we're talking about the minimum work you can do.c Some architectures with very weak memory models (I'm looking at you, Alpha) may require some type of read barrier before a final read - but these are very rare today.","[""class SomeClass {   public static HashMap<Object, Object> MAP;   public synchronized static setMap(HashMap<Object, Object> m) {     MAP = m;   }}"", ""HashMap<Object,Object> map = SomeClass.MAP;if (map != null) {  .. use the map} else {  .. some default behavior}"", ""public static volatile HashMap<Object, Object> MAP;""]",Containers in Depth,"{""Understanding Maps"": 2.05, ""Utilities"": 0.9}"

This looks like not the best solution, because if I sleep for long period then unwanted delay is added, if I sleep for short period then it can affect performance.I could try using --CODE--and decrease countdown when task is complete and do --CODE--, but I found it possible only if I control Future creation. It is possible, but requires system redesign, because currently logic of tasks creation (sending Callable to ExecutorService) is separated from decision to wait for which Future. I could also override --CODE--and create custom implementation of RunnableFuture with ability to attach listener to be notified when task is finished, then attach such listener to needed tasks and use CountDownLatch, but that means I have to override newTaskFor for every ExecutorService I use - and potentially there will be implementation which do not extend AbstractExecutorService. I could also try wrapping given ExecutorService for same purpose, but then I have to decorate all methods producing Futures.All these solutions may work but seem very unnatural. It looks like I'm missing something simple, like --CODE--in c#.

Your algorithm sounds like it would be susceptible to cache contention between multiple CPUs - this is particularly nasty because it has the potential to hit the performance of all of your threads (normally you think of using multiple threads to continue processing while waiting for slow or high latency IO operations).Cache contention is a very important aspect of using multi CPUs to process a highly parallelized algorithm:  Make sure that you take your memory utilization into account.  If you can construct your data objects so each thread has it's own memory that it is working on, you can greatly reduce cache contention between the CPUs.  For example, it may be easier to have a big array of ints and have different threads working on different parts of that array - but in Java, the bounds checks on that array are going to be trying to access the same address in memory, which can cause a given CPU to have to reload data from L2 or L3 cache.Splitting the data into it's own data structures, and configure those data structures so they are thread local (might even be more optimal to use [ThreadLocal](""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/ThreadLocal.html"") - that actually uses constructs in the OS that provide guarantees that the CPU can use to optimize cache.The best piece of advice I can give you is test, test, test.  Don't make assumptions about how CPUs will perform - there is a huge amount of magic going on in CPUs these days, often with counterintuitive results.

One area of improvement that we found we could make with this function was to cache the responses from the web service for some period of time, since the data is not changing.After implementing this basic caching, in some further testing I found out that I didn't consider how concurrent threads could access the Cache at the same time.

I accepted the first answer about intern()ing Strings, which solved my initial problem - where multiple threads were entering synchronized blocks where I thought they shouldn't, because the key's had the same value.As others have pointed out, using intern() for such a purpose and synchronizing on those Strings does indeed turn out to be a bad idea - when running JMeter tests against the webapp to simulate the expected load, I saw the used heap size grow to almost 1GB in just under 20 minutes.Currently I'm using the simple solution of just synchronizing the entire method - but I really like the code samples provided by martinprobst and MBCook, but since I have about 7 similar getData() methods in this class currently (since it needs about 7 different pieces of data from a web service), I didn't want to add almost-duplicate logic about getting and releasing locks to each method. But this is definitely very, very valuable info for future usage. I think these are ultimately the correct answers on how best to make an operation like this thread-safe, and I'd give out more votes to these answers if I could!","[""private SomeData[] getSomeDataByEmail(WebServiceInterface service, String email) {  final String key = \""Data-\"" + email;  SomeData[] data = (SomeData[]) StaticCache.get(key);  if (data == null) {      data = service.getSomeDataForEmail(email);      StaticCache.set(key, data, CACHE_TIME);  }  else {      logger.debug(\""getSomeDataForEmail: using cached object\"");  }  return data;}"", ""private SomeData[] getSomeDataByEmail(WebServiceInterface service, String email) {  SomeData[] data = null;  final String key = \""Data-\"" + email;  synchronized(key) {          data =(SomeData[]) StaticCache.get(key);    if (data == null) {        data = service.getSomeDataForEmail(email);        StaticCache.set(key, data, CACHE_TIME);    }    else {      logger.debug(\""getSomeDataForEmail: using cached object\"");    }  }  return data;}"", ""final String key = \""blah\"";...synchronized(key) { ...""]",<java><multithreading><synchronization><thread-safety><synchronized>,134014,"Without putting my brain fully into gear, from a quick scan of what you say it looks as though you need to intern() your Strings:--CODE--Two Strings with the same value are otherwise not necessarily the same object.Note that this may introduce a new point of contention, since deep in the VM, intern() may have to acquire a lock. I have no idea what modern VMs look like in this area, but one hopes they are fiendishly optimised.I assume you know that StaticCache still needs to be thread-safe. But the contention there should be tiny compared with what you'd have if you were locking on the cache rather than just the key while calling getSomeDataForEmail.Response to question update:I think that's because a string literal always yields the same object. Dave Costa points out in a comment that it's even better than that: a literal always yields the canonical representation. So all String literals with the same value anywhere in the program would yield the same object.EditOthers have pointed out that synchronizing on intern strings is actually a really bad idea - partly because creating intern strings is permitted to cause them to exist in perpetuity, and partly because if more than one bit of code anywhere in your program synchronizes on intern strings, you have dependencies between those bits of code, and preventing deadlocks or other bugs may be impossible.Strategies to avoid this by storing a lock object per key string are being developed in other answers as I type.Here's an alternative - it still uses a singular lock, but we know we're going to need one of those for the cache anyway, and you were talking about 50 threads, not 5000, so that may not be fatal. I'm also assuming that the performance bottleneck here is slow blocking I/O in DoSlowThing() which will therefore hugely benefit from not being serialised. If that's not the bottleneck, then:If the CPU is busy then this approach may not be sufficient and you need another approach.If the CPU is not busy, and access to server is not a bottleneck, then this approach is overkill, and you might as well forget both this and per-key locking, put a big synchronized(StaticCache) around the whole operation, and do it the easy way.Obviously this approach needs to be soak tested for scalability before use -- I guarantee nothing.This code does NOT require that StaticCache is synchronized or otherwise thread-safe. That needs to be revisited if any other code (for example scheduled clean-up of old data) ever touches the cache.IN_PROGRESS is a dummy value - not exactly clean, but the code's simple and it saves having two hashtables. It doesn't handle InterruptedException because I don't know what your app wants to do in that case. Also, if DoSlowThing() consistently fails for a given key this code as it stands is not exactly elegant, since every thread through will retry it. Since I don't know what the failure criteria are, and whether they are liable to be temporary or permanent, I don't handle this either, I just make sure threads don't block forever. In practice you may want to put a data value in the cache which indicates 'not available', perhaps with a reason, and a timeout for when to retry.--CODE--Every time anything is added to the cache, all threads wake up and check the cache (no matter what key they're after), so it's possible to get better performance with less contentious algorithms. However, much of that work will take place during your copious idle CPU time blocking on I/O, so it may not be a problem.This code could be commoned-up for use with multiple caches, if you define suitable abstractions for the cache and its associated lock, the data it returns, the IN_PROGRESS dummy, and the slow operation to perform. Rolling the whole thing into a method on the cache might not be a bad idea.","[""final String firstkey = \""Data-\"" + email;final String key = firstkey.intern();"", ""// do not attempt double-check locking here.

I believe this is done so the JTree knows whether to show a + icon next to the node.An accurate count of children from getChildCount() would need to perform the potentially expensive operation If I fake the value of getChildCount(), the tree only allocates space for that many child nodes before asking for an enumeration of the children.

I'd recommend either creating your own ExecutorService that take a condition n addition to the future and only executes the future when the condition changes, or creating a management service that will check conditions and submit given futures based on these conditions.
