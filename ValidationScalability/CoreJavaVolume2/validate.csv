These classes will be serialized using XStream somewhere.  Your Swing Classes then have methods to receive these model classes and populate the fields and editors.  You can then extend the UI, for example, without having to change the class, adding more funcionality, or provide different views for the same data set.To make it fancier, the Swing Component should not store and load the model, but you should have a controller interface that you pass to the swing component to perform these operations.  This way, you can unit test better and you decouple the storage logic from the view logic.If XStream is correctly configured, and if you are careful about the model and the fields, it should be possible to add more fields to your model classes without breaking backwards compatibility.I don't recommend using Java Serialization anyways, as it is not a good practice to use it for storage.

Also your code shouldn't even attempt to call fireTableDataChanged() on the model, since this type of call should be called internally by the model itself only.For example, my MCVE:--CODE--    --CODE--    --CODE--    --CODE--","[""import java.awt.BorderLayout;import java.awt.event.ActionEvent;import java.awt.event.KeyEvent;import java.util.Random;import javax.swing.*;import javax.swing.table.*;public class TableExample {    private static void createAndShowGui() {        TablePanel tablePanel = new TablePanel();        JMenuItem fillTableItem = new JMenuItem(new FillTableAction(tablePanel));        JMenuItem clearTableItem = new JMenuItem(new ClearTableAction(tablePanel));        JMenu tableMenu = new JMenu(\""Table Actions\"");        tableMenu.setMnemonic(KeyEvent.VK_T);        tableMenu.add(fillTableItem);        tableMenu.add(clearTableItem);        JMenuBar menuBar = new JMenuBar();        menuBar.add(tableMenu);        JFrame frame = new JFrame(\""TableExample\"");        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);        frame.getContentPane().add(tablePanel);        frame.setJMenuBar(menuBar);        frame.pack();        frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);        frame.setVisible(true);    }    public static void main(String[] args) {        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -> createAndShowGui());    }}"", ""@SuppressWarnings(\""serial\"")class FillTableAction extends AbstractAction {    private TablePanel tablePanel;    public FillTableAction(TablePanel tablePanel) {        super(\""Fill Table\"");        putValue(MNEMONIC_KEY, KeyEvent.VK_F);        this.tablePanel = tablePanel;    }    @Override    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {        tablePanel.fillTable();    }}"", ""@SuppressWarnings(\""serial\"")class ClearTableAction extends AbstractAction {    private TablePanel tablePanel;    public ClearTableAction(TablePanel tablePanel) {        super(\""Clear Table\"");        putValue(MNEMONIC_KEY, KeyEvent.VK_C);        this.tablePanel = tablePanel;    }    @Override    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {        tablePanel.clearTable();    }}"", ""@SuppressWarnings(\""serial\"")class TablePanel extends JPanel {    private static final String[] COL_NAMES = { \""Name\"", \""Surname\"", \""ID\"" };    private DefaultTableModel model = new DefaultTableModel(COL_NAMES, 0);    private JTable table = new JTable(model);    private Random random = new Random();    public TablePanel() {        setLayout(new BorderLayout());        add(new JScrollPane(table));    }    public void clearTable() {        model.setRowCount(0);    }    // fill it with random text and data    public void fillTable() {        int rows = random.nextInt(50) + 40;        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();            char c = (char) ('A' + random.nextInt(26));            sb.append(c);            for (int j = 0; j < 4 + random.nextInt(3); j++) {                sb.append((char) ('a' + random.nextInt(26)));            }            String name = sb.toString();            sb.delete(0, sb.length());            sb.append((char) ('A' + random.nextInt(26)));            for (int j = 0; j < 6 + random.nextInt(4); j++) {                sb.append((char) ('a' + random.nextInt(26)));            }            String surName = sb.toString();            int id = random.nextInt(Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2);            Object[] rowData = { name, surName, id };            model.addRow(rowData);        }    }}""]",Advanced Swing,"{""Tables"": 1.0, ""Progress Indicators"": 0.7}"

Then when the Timer fires you just calculate the new position and repaint the Ball.Here is an example to get you started:--CODE--Since your Arrays only contain the Point you want to paint you don't have any information about the speed each point should be moved at. The best you could do is create a random amount each point should be moved each time its location is changed. This would give erratic movement as each time you move a point the distance would be random. If you want more constant speed then you would need to create a second Array to contain the distance each point should move every time. This starts to get messy creating a new Array every time you want a new property to be unique for the object you want to paint. That is why the approach to create a custom Object with multiple properties is easier to manage.","[""import java.awt.*;import java.awt.event.*;import java.awt.image.*;import java.util.*;import javax.swing.*;import javax.swing.Timer;public class BallAnimation4{    private static void createAndShowUI()    {        BallPanel panel = new BallPanel();        JFrame frame = new JFrame(\""BallAnimation4\"");        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);        frame.add( panel );        frame.setSize(800, 600);        frame.setLocationRelativeTo( null );        //frame.setExtendedState(JFrame.MAXIMIZED_BOTH);        frame.setVisible( true );        panel.addBalls(5);        panel.startAnimation();    }    public static void main(String[] args)    {        EventQueue.invokeLater(new Runnable()        {            public void run()            {                createAndShowUI();            }        });    }}class BallPanel extends JPanel implements ActionListener{    private ArrayList<Ball> balls = new ArrayList<Ball>();    public BallPanel()    {        setLayout( null );        setBackground( Color.BLACK );    }    public void addBalls(int ballCount)    {        Random random = new Random();        for (int i = 0; i < ballCount; i++)        {            Ball ball = new Ball();            ball.setRandomColor(true);            ball.setLocation(random.nextInt(getWidth()), random.nextInt(getHeight()));            ball.setMoveRate(32, 32, 1, 1, true);//          ball.setMoveRate(16, 16, 1, 1, true);            ball.setSize(32, 32);            balls.add( ball );        }    }    @Override    public void paintComponent(Graphics g)    {        super.paintComponent(g);        for (Ball ball: balls)        {            ball.draw(g);        }    }    public void startAnimation()    {        Timer timer = new Timer(75, this);        timer.start();    }    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e)    {        move();        repaint();    }    private void move()    {        for (Ball ball : balls)        {            ball.move(this);        }    }    class Ball    {        public Color color = Color.BLACK;        public int x = 0;        public int y = 0;        public int width  = 1;        public int height = 1;        private int moveX = 1;        private int moveY = 1;        private int directionX = 1;        private int directionY = 1;        private int xScale = moveX;        private int yScale = moveY;        private boolean randomMove = false;        private boolean randomColor = false;        private Random myRand = null;        public Ball()        {            myRand = new Random();            setRandomColor(randomColor);        }        public void move(JPanel parent)        {            int iRight = parent.getSize().width;            int iBottom = parent.getSize().height;            x += 5 + (xScale * directionX);            y += 5 + (yScale * directionY);            if (x <= 0)            {                x = 0;                directionX *= (-1);                xScale = randomMove ?

It could be the limiting factor, especially if your database sits on the other side of the world.First establish what is the latency between the client and the database server. If it's 10 ms than inserting this row by row would be: 100,000 * 200 * 10ms = 200000s ~ 56h. This is very slow so make sure you are using batch inserts with JDBC. Sometimes the insertion process can be significantly speed up by creating a shadow table:Create new tables that are identical to OrderEvents and PreCondition tables. Some RDBMS allow for CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT ...  FROM ... syntax.Disable foreign keys and indexes on the shadow tables.Bulk insert all the data.Enable foreign keys and indexes on shadow tables. This will hopefully ensure that imported data was correct.Insert from shadow tables into the actual tables e.g. by running INSERT INTO ... SELECT ... FROM ....Delete shadow table.However the best option would be to skip JDBC and switch to bulk load utility provided by your database e.g. Oracle DB has [External Tables](""https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14215/et_concepts.htm"") and [SQL*Loader](""https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14215/ldr_concepts.htm"").

5206421,5206756,How to Implement caching for a web application,"What are the different ways to cache a web application data, developed using Java and NoSQL database? Databases also provide caching, are they, the only &amp; always the best option to go with, for caching?How else can I cache my data of users on the application. Application contains very user specific data like in a social network. Are there some simple thumb rules of what type of things should be cached?Can I also cache my data on the application server using Java ? ",[],<java><database><caching><web-applications>,5206756,"I'll assume you're building a relatively typical web application that:has a single server used for persistence multiple web servers ties authenticated users to a single server via sticky sessions through a load balancerNow, with that stated to answer so of your questions. Most persistence, database or NoSQL, likely have some sort of caching built in such that if you execute the same simple query repeatedly (e.g. retrieval by primary key) it's able to cache the result. However, the more complex the query, the less likely persistence can perform caching on it. In addition, if there's only one server for persistence (i.e. no sharding, or write master/read slaves) it quickly becomes the bottleneck. So the application level caching you want to do usually should occur on the web servers to reduce load on the database. As far as what should be cached, the heuristic is items frequently accessed and/or expensive to generate (in terms of database/web server processing/memory). Typical candidates are the home page and any other landing page of a site - often the best approach for these is generating a static file and serving that. The next pieces depend on your application, but typically the most effective strategy is caching as close to the final result as possible - often the HTML being served. For your social network this might be a list of featured updates or some such. As far as user sessions are concerned, these are definitely a good candidate for caching. In this case you can probably get a lot of mileage out of judicious use of the web server's session scope (assuming a JSP server). This data lives in memory and is a good place to keep of user specific information shown once a user authenticates on every page (e.g. first and last name). Now the final thing to consider is dealing with cache invalidation and really is the hard part of all this ([naming stuff is the other hard thing in computer science](""http://laughingmeme.org/2005/12/23/there-are-only-two-hard-things-in-computer-science-cache-invalidation-and-naming-things/"")). In this case using something like memcached or ehcache as others have mentioned is the right approach. ehcache can easily run in process with your java application and does a good job of expiring things, with policies for least recently used and least frequently used, and allowing you to use both memory and disk for caching. What you'll need to think about is the situations where you need to expire something form the cache ahead of this schedule because data's changed. In this case you need to work through those dependencies in your application's architecture so that it read/writes to the cache as appropriate. ",[],Database Programming,"{""Row Sets"": 0.7}"

10108630,,How to simulate database failure to test 2-phase commit in Java,"I am implementing a 2-phase commit involving distributed resources. How do I simulate the failure of a participating database ? Pulling out the network cable doesn't work as it causes table deadlock. I am currently using hooks in my application code which throw StaleConnectionException at different points like before query execution, after query execution. My concern with this approach is:Is there a better way to simulate the DB failure?What happens to the connection object when DB connection goes bad? Does it retain its value or does it become null?What actually happens when application tries to reconnect to DB?What value does connection object get?Does it use an existing value from the connection pool? I would also like to test at intermediate points like during query execution, during commit (after prepare is sent, etc). Right now I put application into debug mode and step into the function call and pull the plug in between. But this approach is manual and won't work for a scale testing.Is there a simulator/emulator or tool which can help me do this?",[],<java><database><transactions><websphere><2phase-commit>,10328428,"That's a lot of questions :) I will try to complete the previous answers. --CODE--Testing all cases is complicated. One way to test the main cases would be to create a JCA connector (a DB driver is is a JCA connector). You can obtain connections from the connector that will be enlisted in the transaction (a third participant). The connection can then raise certain errors. There are three parts that work together: (1) the application, (2) the app. server's transaction manager, and (3) the jca connector (so-called resource adapter). The connection hooks itself into the transaction via ManagedConnection.getXAResource. With a custom jca connector you can then raise exception to the application (Connection in the picutre) or the application server's transaction manager (XAResource obtained via the ManagedConnection in picture). You can notably throw exception during XAResource.prepare and XAResource.commit, that corresponds to errors during the 2 phase commit.  Note that it is hard to control the order of enlisment of the participants (see [). So it easy to test that one of the prepare fails (namely yours), but it's hard to control the order in which they are called. Reproducing all possible invalid states of 2 phase commit is complicated, especially when taking optimization into play. (I wrote once a JCA connector (http://code.google.com/p/txfs](""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2418292/delivery-of-jms-message-before-the-transaction-is-committed"">this)) and there are others around, if you want sample code.) --CODE--The ManagedConnection can notify to the transaction manager. One of the notification is ConnectionEvent.CONNECTION_ERROR_OCCURRED that informs it that an error occurred when using this particular connection.As noted in other answer, there is normally one managed connection associated per transaction. The managed connection abstracts the physical connection, and you don't want to use too many. The application obtains only ""handles"" (Connection in the picture). The handles obtain within one given transaction all point to the same managed connection. This is an optimization that most app servers support. If the managed connection become invalid, the handles that use it become invalid as well. But the handles can AFAIK not be ""refreshed"". The transaction must rollback, the managed connection is destroyed. When another transaction starts it will be associated to another valid managed connection from the pool. --CODE--The app server manages a pool of managed connection. As said in previous paragraph, one might go bad while it is used. But one can also go bad without being used. For instance, an used managed connection in the pool might become invalid because the underlying physical connection timed out. App servers have usually a feature to test whether a managed connection is valid, before it starts using it. If not, it will try another managed connection from the pool, or create a new one.

Setting the focusability state on a visible  Window can have a delayed effect on some platforms 鈥?the actual change  may happen only when the Window becomes hidden and then visible again.  To ensure consistent behavior across platforms, set the Window's  focusable state when the Window is invisible and then show it.And [isFocusableWindow](""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Window.html#isFocusableWindow--"")  Returns whether this Window can become the focused Window, that is, whether this Window or any of its subcomponents can become the focus owner. For a Frame or Dialog to be focusable, its focusable Window state must be set to true. For a Window which is not a Frame or Dialog to be focusable, its focusable Window state must be set to true, its nearest owning Frame or Dialog must be showing on the screen, and it must contain at least one Component in its focus traversal cycle. If any of these conditions is not met, then neither this Window nor any of its subcomponents can become the focus owner.",[],Advanced Swing,"{""Text Components"": 0.6}"

11311648,11312503,how to create a chat client in java,"I have a java application that people can log into (and do various things with a database with, but that's not important).  I can use the .getInetAddress() to get the IP addresses of the people logged into the server, however I am not sure how exactly to communicate between the threads.  I am trying to add a chat service to this pre-existing program.My program uses a standard multi-threaded server, and the clinet is a single threaded AWT Action Listener program. What is the best way to do this?  My code includes a class containing main that creates a new ""Client Handler"" class and creates a new thread to handle it.  Currently there is no inter-thread communication, the thread spawns on it's own socket port and runs independently on the server.  My previous thoughts include:Put the client into a blocking state with ObjectInputStream and wait for the client to receive a message (instead of busy waiting for a button to be pressed), with the condition that when the client goes to perform an action (edit a field), it would release the blocking I/O and perform the method, then go back to the blocked I/O ""Waiting"" stage of the program.Things I'm not sure about this:If i invoke the blocking I/O, will the AWT ActionListener unblock the blocking I/O and jump to the event handler?If the client is in code (not on the blocking InputStream) and a message is sent, will the server know to wait until the program is back on the inputStream before it sends the message, or will it send the message and create a queue, or worse cashe, problem.The server is multithreaded, If John is at 192.168.1.100 and Larry is at 192.168.1.152 and John wants to send a message to Larry, how do I get the message from thread handling *.100, to thread handling *.152 so it can be outputted to the right client on the right socket.My other thought (and maybe the easier one) would be to make the client multi-threaded, connect to the server on a different port, and use a whole different set of socket connections to handle the events.  In this case i can just use a blocking I/O wait, when i get the message, output it, and then go back to the blocking I/O.  There wouldn't be any issues in miss communication between the production code and the chat code, and from that stance it is better, however this means I would need to have 2 open connections on different ports for every client that connects.  The program will eventually have thousands of users connected to it at one time, and I do not want to hog all the server ports with one application.Are their other ways of doing this without flooding the ports or risking communication errors?",[],<java><multithreading><sockets><network-programming><communication>,11312503,"Your client should be using 3 threads.  All gui interactions should be done from the EDT.  Then, you should have a thread for the socket InputStream and a thread for the socket OutputStream (both of which block can potentially block).  when you want to send a message, your gui thread should use some sort of thread-safe queue to pass the message to the OutputStream thread.  any messages received by the InputStream thread should use something like SwingUtilities.invokeLater to push the message to the gui.i'm not exactly sure what you are saying about the sockets and ports.  every client which is connected to the server will require a separate socket connection (which will involve a separate port)",[],Networking,"{""Implementing Servers"": 0.8, ""Interruptible Sockets"": 0.8}"
