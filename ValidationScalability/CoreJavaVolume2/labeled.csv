Serializing Swing components is anyways not recommended at all:  [While Swing components do implement the Serializable interface, they are not portable between different versions of the Java Virtual Machine](""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization#Java"")Looking at what you have, you should have some classes that are your model and have only data.  These classes will be serialized using XStream somewhere.  Your Swing Classes then have methods to receive these model classes and populate the fields and editors.  You can then extend the UI, for example, without having to change the class, adding more funcionality, or provide different views for the same data set.To make it fancier, the Swing Component should not store and load the model, but you should have a controller interface that you pass to the swing component to perform these operations.  This way, you can unit test better and you decouple the storage logic from the view logic.If XStream is correctly configured, and if you are careful about the model and the fields, it should be possible to add more fields to your model classes without breaking backwards compatibility.I don't recommend using Java Serialization anyways, as it is not a good practice to use it for storage.  Java Serialization excels at Remote Method Invocation.  It is relatively fragile when the model classes change..",[],Advanced AWT,"{""Platform Integration"": 1.5}"

Just add it back to the contentPane. Don't touch the contentPane, it is the key.Set the layout of panel without hardcoded row height, column width, etc. This may ruin the layout, because your hardcoded height may be lesser or more of it is needed, leaving some line with wrong size, and leave your last line/column half cut off.Add your elements into panel. When adding them you can specify sizes.Add panel back to contentPane: getContentPane().add(panel); We don't need to set the layout of contentPane. At last, pack(), setVisible(true) as you wish.

You have a couple problems.First, you should only see a grey screen with a black rectangle in the middle since you have nothing in your Bullet and Enemy Arrays. This is what I got when I ran your code (after removing references to endEvent cuz it couldn't find it). So to fix this, just give it something to drawThe second problem is apparent once you give it something to draw. I manually put in a line of code to draw the Player, for which I used one of my own pngs. When you do this it will fail to compile with a null pointer exception. The reason is because in your GameView class, you have your Graphics object called ""graphics"" set to null, but then you proceed to call paintComponents(graphics). As mentioned before, this only compiled before because you never actually drew anything. To fix this, you can just remove --CODE--and let the overridden paintComponent(Graphics g) method above it do all the work. Additionally, instead of the paintComponents(graphics) calls, use repaint(). Also you can get rid of the first call to paintComponents(graphics) in the constructor as it will paint the first time by default. If you really want to use your own method then you have to create a Graphics object and pass that in. Lastly, in the overridden paintComponents(Graphics g) method, you have the last line being to draw the giant black box. This will then cover up anything you've drawn before. So you should have that as the first line and draw everything else in order such that the thing you want to be on top should be drawn last. I was able to get my test image to show up with the following code for that class. I don't think I changed anything else.--CODE--The other thing is in some of your other classes you have @Override over the actionPerformed method. My IDE doesn't like that, although it does compile. It says ""@Override is not allowed when implementing interface methods.""Hopefully this works for you.

Instead, have a Ball object manage its own state. Then you can have different color, speed, size etc for each Ball. Then when the Timer fires you just calculate the new position and repaint the Ball.Here is an example to get you started:--CODE--Since your Arrays only contain the Point you want to paint you don't have any information about the speed each point should be moved at. The best you could do is create a random amount each point should be moved each time its location is changed. This would give erratic movement as each time you move a point the distance would be random. If you want more constant speed then you would need to create a second Array to contain the distance each point should move every time. This starts to get messy creating a new Array every time you want a new property to be unique for the object you want to paint.

It could be the limiting factor, especially if your database sits on the other side of the world.First establish what is the latency between the client and the database server. If it's 10 ms than inserting this row by row would be: 100,000 * 200 * 10ms = 200000s ~ 56h. This is very slow so make sure you are using batch inserts with JDBC. Sometimes the insertion process can be significantly speed up by creating a shadow table:Create new tables that are identical to OrderEvents and PreCondition tables. Some RDBMS allow for CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT ...  FROM ... syntax.Disable foreign keys and indexes on the shadow tables.Bulk insert all the data.Enable foreign keys and indexes on shadow tables. This will hopefully ensure that imported data was correct.Insert from shadow tables into the actual tables e.g. by running INSERT INTO ... SELECT ... FROM ....Delete shadow table.However the best option would be to skip JDBC and switch to bulk load utility provided by your database e.g. Oracle DB has [External Tables](""https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14215/et_concepts.htm"") and [SQL*Loader](""https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14215/ldr_concepts.htm"").

5206421,5206756,How to Implement caching for a web application,"What are the different ways to cache a web application data, developed using Java and NoSQL database? Databases also provide caching, are they, the only &amp; always the best option to go with, for caching?How else can I cache my data of users on the application. Application contains very user specific data like in a social network. Are there some simple thumb rules of what type of things should be cached?Can I also cache my data on the application server using Java ? ",[],<java><database><caching><web-applications>,5206756,"I'll assume you're building a relatively typical web application that:has a single server used for persistence multiple web servers ties authenticated users to a single server via sticky sessions through a load balancerNow, with that stated to answer so of your questions. Most persistence, database or NoSQL, likely have some sort of caching built in such that if you execute the same simple query repeatedly (e.g. retrieval by primary key) it's able to cache the result. However, the more complex the query, the less likely persistence can perform caching on it. In addition, if there's only one server for persistence (i.e. no sharding, or write master/read slaves) it quickly becomes the bottleneck. So the application level caching you want to do usually should occur on the web servers to reduce load on the database. As far as what should be cached, the heuristic is items frequently accessed and/or expensive to generate (in terms of database/web server processing/memory). Typical candidates are the home page and any other landing page of a site - often the best approach for these is generating a static file and serving that. The next pieces depend on your application, but typically the most effective strategy is caching as close to the final result as possible - often the HTML being served. For your social network this might be a list of featured updates or some such. As far as user sessions are concerned, these are definitely a good candidate for caching. In this case you can probably get a lot of mileage out of judicious use of the web server's session scope (assuming a JSP server). This data lives in memory and is a good place to keep of user specific information shown once a user authenticates on every page (e.g. first and last name). Now the final thing to consider is dealing with cache invalidation and really is the hard part of all this ([naming stuff is the other hard thing in computer science](""http://laughingmeme.org/2005/12/23/there-are-only-two-hard-things-in-computer-science-cache-invalidation-and-naming-things/"")). In this case using something like memcached or ehcache as others have mentioned is the right approach. ehcache can easily run in process with your java application and does a good job of expiring things, with policies for least recently used and least frequently used, and allowing you to use both memory and disk for caching. What you'll need to think about is the situations where you need to expire something form the cache ahead of this schedule because data's changed. In this case you need to work through those dependencies in your application's architecture so that it read/writes to the cache as appropriate. ",[],Database Programming,"{""Row Sets"": 0.7}"

There are multiple ways you might be able to do this, but first, I would start by defining away for those classes to be able to only effect the change you want them to.Exposing the entire frame, component or even button is not a good idea, people have a habit of changing things you don't want them to, so instead, we define a simple contract which states what they are allowed to do, for example...--CODE--This immediately decouples your code, meaning that any code that wants to change the state of your UI (or change the color of something else) can do so, without relying on the physical implementation.ThreadFirst, we're going to have a look at using a Thread to change the UI...--CODE--This is a pretty basic class, it requires an instance of Colorable and will change the state of the color for every 100 counts, based on if it's an even or odd hundredWe use a simple JPanel as our base test class, when you click the button, the ColorChanger is created and started.--CODE--You will note that the setColor method has a bunch of code in it, this is to ensure that the updates to the UI are executed only from within the context of the Event Dispatching Thread.SwingWorkerAn alternative is to use a SwingWorker, which operates very similarly to a Thread, expect it has the ability to publish content to the EDT--CODE--You will note here, that when we want to change the color we call publish.  The process method is called to let us know that there is more data to be processed, but here, we're only interested in the last change.And out TestPane...--CODE--You will note that the setColor method remains unchanged, this is deliberate, when you test this class, you will note that ""Not in the EDT"" is never printed, basically meaning we could do away with all that code and just call btn.setBackground(color);, but I want you to see the difference.The Button...Now, when I run this code, I get the following output...[](""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1nTPy.png"")Wait a minute, that buttons background is filled?!

One way to test the main cases would be to create a JCA connector (a DB driver is is a JCA connector). You can obtain connections from the connector that will be enlisted in the transaction (a third participant). The connection can then raise certain errors. There are three parts that work together: (1) the application, (2) the app. server's transaction manager, and (3) the jca connector (so-called resource adapter). The connection hooks itself into the transaction via ManagedConnection.getXAResource. With a custom jca connector you can then raise exception to the application (Connection in the picutre) or the application server's transaction manager (XAResource obtained via the ManagedConnection in picture). You can notably throw exception during XAResource.prepare and XAResource.commit, that corresponds to errors during the 2 phase commit.  Note that it is hard to control the order of enlisment of the participants (see [). So it easy to test that one of the prepare fails (namely yours), but it's hard to control the order in which they are called. Reproducing all possible invalid states of 2 phase commit is complicated, especially when taking optimization into play. (I wrote once a JCA connector (http://code.google.com/p/txfs](""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2418292/delivery-of-jms-message-before-the-transaction-is-committed"">this)) and there are others around, if you want sample code.) --CODE--The ManagedConnection can notify to the transaction manager. One of the notification is ConnectionEvent.CONNECTION_ERROR_OCCURRED that informs it that an error occurred when using this particular connection.As noted in other answer, there is normally one managed connection associated per transaction. The managed connection abstracts the physical connection, and you don't want to use too many. The application obtains only ""handles"" (Connection in the picture). The handles obtain within one given transaction all point to the same managed connection. This is an optimization that most app servers support. If the managed connection become invalid, the handles that use it become invalid as well. But the handles can AFAIK not be ""refreshed"". The transaction must rollback, the managed connection is destroyed. When another transaction starts it will be associated to another valid managed connection from the pool. --CODE--The app server manages a pool of managed connection. As said in previous paragraph, one might go bad while it is used. But one can also go bad without being used. For instance, an used managed connection in the pool might become invalid because the underlying physical connection timed out. App servers have usually a feature to test whether a managed connection is valid, before it starts using it. If not, it will try another managed connection from the pool, or create a new one.

You are constructing it wrong. Here are my suggestions. Download XMLSpy or Liquid XML studio and then view my examples to see how to construct a proper XSD and then validate the XSD against it. These editors are a great way to visually see the XML documents and xsd's. They will help a lot.Essentially you need to declare your types in the XSD then create elements based on those types. While your approach can work I would suggest that you study the approach I have taken it is pretty easy.

7314672,7522067,Java bitmap font: blitting 1-bit image with different colors,"I'd like to implement a simple bitmap font drawing in Java AWT-based application. Application draws on a Graphics object, where I'd like to implement a simple algorithm:1) Load a file (probably using ImageIO.read(new File(fileName))), which is 1-bit PNG that looks something like that:I.e. it's 16*16 (or 16*many, if I'd like to support Unicode) matrix of 8*8 characters. Black corresponds to background color, white corresponds to foreground.2) Draw strings character-by-character, blitting relevant parts of this bitmap to target Graphics. So far I've only succeeded with something like that:--CODE--It works, but, alas, it blits the text as is, i.e. I can't substitute black and white with desired foreground and background colors, and I can't even make background transparent.So, the question is: is there a simple (and fast!) way in Java to blit part of one 1-bit bitmap to another, colorizing it in process of blitting (i.e. replacing all 0 pixels with one given color and all 1 pixels with another)?I've researched into a couple of solutions, all of them look suboptimal to me:Using a custom colorizing [BufferedImageOp](""http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/awt/image/BufferedImageOp.html""), as outlined in [ - it should work, but it seems that it would be very inefficient to recolorize a bitmap before every blit operation.Using multiple 32-bit RGBA PNG, with alpha channel set to 0 for black pixels and to maximum for foreground. Every desired foreground color should get its own pre-rendered bitmap. This way I can make background transparent and draw it as a rectangle separately before blitting and then select one bitmap with my font, pre-colorized with desired color and draw a portion of it over that rectangle. Seems like a huge overkill to me - and what makes this option even worse - it limits number of foreground colors to a relatively small amount (i.e. I can realistically load up and hold like hundreds or thousands of bitmaps, not millions)Bundling and loading a custom font, as outlined in this solution](""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23763/colorizing-images-in-java"">this) could work, but as far as I see in [Font#createFont](""http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/awt/Font.html#createFont(int,%20java.io.InputStream)"") documentation, AWT's Font seems to work only with vector-based fonts, not with bitmap-based.May be there's already any libraries that implement such functionality?

11311648,11312503,how to create a chat client in java,"I have a java application that people can log into (and do various things with a database with, but that's not important).  I can use the .getInetAddress() to get the IP addresses of the people logged into the server, however I am not sure how exactly to communicate between the threads.  I am trying to add a chat service to this pre-existing program.My program uses a standard multi-threaded server, and the clinet is a single threaded AWT Action Listener program. What is the best way to do this?  My code includes a class containing main that creates a new ""Client Handler"" class and creates a new thread to handle it.  Currently there is no inter-thread communication, the thread spawns on it's own socket port and runs independently on the server.  My previous thoughts include:Put the client into a blocking state with ObjectInputStream and wait for the client to receive a message (instead of busy waiting for a button to be pressed), with the condition that when the client goes to perform an action (edit a field), it would release the blocking I/O and perform the method, then go back to the blocked I/O ""Waiting"" stage of the program.Things I'm not sure about this:If i invoke the blocking I/O, will the AWT ActionListener unblock the blocking I/O and jump to the event handler?If the client is in code (not on the blocking InputStream) and a message is sent, will the server know to wait until the program is back on the inputStream before it sends the message, or will it send the message and create a queue, or worse cashe, problem.The server is multithreaded, If John is at 192.168.1.100 and Larry is at 192.168.1.152 and John wants to send a message to Larry, how do I get the message from thread handling *.100, to thread handling *.152 so it can be outputted to the right client on the right socket.My other thought (and maybe the easier one) would be to make the client multi-threaded, connect to the server on a different port, and use a whole different set of socket connections to handle the events.  In this case i can just use a blocking I/O wait, when i get the message, output it, and then go back to the blocking I/O.  There wouldn't be any issues in miss communication between the production code and the chat code, and from that stance it is better, however this means I would need to have 2 open connections on different ports for every client that connects.  The program will eventually have thousands of users connected to it at one time, and I do not want to hog all the server ports with one application.Are their other ways of doing this without flooding the ports or risking communication errors?",[],<java><multithreading><sockets><network-programming><communication>,11312503,"Your client should be using 3 threads.  All gui interactions should be done from the EDT.  Then, you should have a thread for the socket InputStream and a thread for the socket OutputStream (both of which block can potentially block).  when you want to send a message, your gui thread should use some sort of thread-safe queue to pass the message to the OutputStream thread.  any messages received by the InputStream thread should use something like SwingUtilities.invokeLater to push the message to the gui.i'm not exactly sure what you are saying about the sockets and ports.  every client which is connected to the server will require a separate socket connection (which will involve a separate port)",[],Networking,"{""Implementing Servers"": 0.8, ""Interruptible Sockets"": 0.8}"
