A LocalTime represents a time of day, such as 15:30:00. You can create an instance
with the now or of methods:
LocalTime rightNow = LocalTime.now();
LocalTime bedtime = LocalTime.of(22, 30); // or LocalTime.of(22, 30, 0)

Table 6.4 shows common operations with local times. The plus and minus operations
wrap around a 24-hour day. For example,
LocalTime wakeup = bedtime.plusHours(8); // wakeup is 6:30:00

NOTE: LocalTime doesn’t concern itself with AM/PM. That silliness is left to a
formatter—see Section 6.6, “Formatting and Parsing,” on p. 365.
