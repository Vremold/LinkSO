11.5 Paint
When you fill a shape, its inside is covered with paint. Use the setPaint method to
set the paint style to an object whose class implements the Paint interface. The Java
2D API provides three such classes:
• The Color class implements the Paint interface. To fill shapes with a solid color,
simply call setPaint with a Color object, such as
g2.setPaint(Color.red);

• The GradientPaint class varies colors by interpolating between two given color
values (see Figure 11.15).

Figure 11.15 Gradient paint
• The TexturePaint class fills an area with repetitions of an image (see Figure 11.16).

Figure 11.16 Texture paint
You can construct a GradientPaint object by specifying two points and the colors
that you want at these two points.
g2.setPaint(new GradientPaint(p1, Color.RED, p2, Color.YELLOW));

Chapter 11

Advanced AWT

Colors are interpolated along the line joining the two points. Colors are constant
along lines perpendicular to that joining line. Points beyond an end point of the
line are given the color at the end point.
Alternatively, if you call the GradientPaint constructor with true for the cyclic
parameter,
g2.setPaint(new GradientPaint(p1, Color.RED, p2, Color.YELLOW, true));

then the color variation cycles and keeps varying beyond the end points.
To construct a TexturePaint object, specify a BufferedImage and an anchor rectangle.
g2.setPaint(new TexturePaint(bufferedImage, anchorRectangle));

We will introduce the BufferedImage class later in this chapter when we discuss images
in detail. The simplest way of obtaining a buffered image is to read an image file:
bufferedImage = ImageIO.read(new File("blue-ball.gif"));

The anchor rectangle is extended indefinitely in x and y directions to tile the entire
coordinate plane. The image is scaled to fit into the anchor and then replicated
into each tile.

GradientPaint(float x1, float y1, Color color1, float x2, float y2, Color color2)
GradientPaint(float x1, float y1, Color color1, float x2, float y2, Color color2, boolean cyclic)
GradientPaint(Point2D p1, Color color1, Point2D p2, Color color2)
GradientPaint(Point2D p1, Color color1, Point2D p2, Color color2, boolean cyclic)

constructs a gradient paint object that fills shapes with color such that the start
point is colored with color1, the end point is colored with color2, and the colors in
between are linearly interpolated. Colors are constant along lines perpendicular to
the line joining the start and the end point. By default, the gradient paint is not
cyclic—that is, points beyond the start and end points are colored with the same
color as the start and end point. If the gradient paint is cyclic, then colors continue
to be interpolated, first returning to the starting point color and then repeating
indefinitely in both directions.
